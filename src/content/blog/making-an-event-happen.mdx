Are you a **newer volunteer or organizer**? Thank you for considering being a point person for an event! We need people like you for our communities to thrive. I do my best to clarify what it looks like to be point person for an event.

Are you an **experienced organizer**? Whenever you ask for help, people probably ask you "what would that entail?" -- hopefully this article makes it easier for you to answer that question!

For this post I'm **assuming** your community group is community-focused and [community-led](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led). If your group is more of a marketing tool for a company, the advice here may not apply.

## Overview

This post includes:

1. A **checklist** of what it takes to make an event happen
2. How to **divvy up** tasks into chunks ("hats")
3. Addressing some common **concerns about delegating**
4. How volunteers can easily **sign up** for tasks (Google Docs or Trello)
5. The **3 types of point person** you should have for each event
6. **Tracking who's on point** for each event

## Making An Event Happen (Checklist)

What goes into making a local community event happen? Here is the checklist I use for my events:

- **1. Venue**
  - [ ] getting / confirming a venue
- **2. Event Marketing**
  - Creating The Event
    - [ ] writing an [event description](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/making-event-descriptions-welcoming/) (e.g. Google Docs)
    - [ ] creating an online event page (e.g. Meetup.com)
  - Spreading The Word
    - [ ] Social Media: Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
    - [ ] Online Communities: Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups, Reddit (note: try [authentic marketing](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/authentic-event-marketing/))
    - [ ] Word of Mouth: telling friends; getting members to tell friends
- **3. Running The Event**
  - Before
    - [ ] food: pre-order food/coffee/snacks
    - [ ] signs: print signs (welcome, bathrooms, wifi)
    - [ ] announcements: preparing an intro script / agenda
    - [ ] coordinating: with the venue, speakers, etc
  - During
    - [ ] food: coffee, snacks, etc
    - [ ] signs: putting up signs, etc
    - [ ] announcements: intro announcements / event framing
    - [ ] welcoming folks at the door
    - [ ] answering questions
  - After
    - [ ] clean up the space
    - [ ] set up next event

## Divvying Up Tasks (Hats)

That list above is a lot for one person to do on their own!! Especially to do over and over, every time you have an event.

Solo organizers are implicitly responsible for everything -- and that's not great for sustainability and inclusion. To be more sustainable and inclusive, you must **divvy up** these responsibilities. The responsibilities I listed above in the checklist are already divvied up! Each task could be be done by a different person, and that would still make sense.

I call any easily-movable responsibility-set a **hat** (as in, "someone who wears many hats"). For example, many groups divvy up "spreading the word" about an event into two separate task groups: **social media** separate from **online communities**. Often different people are willing to do these. It's a different headspace, and the messaging style for these are very different. These are different "hats"!

Sometimes one person wears all of the related hats in a section, and that's okay -- but it's even better if we can harness the power of the group! We can get more people involved by tailoring these tasks to the interest and availability of our people. This is easier when we're mentally ready to **split tasks** into hats (more in the Task Sign-Up section in a bit!).

Not only is this less work for that previously-solo-organizer, it's also healthier for the group! Getting more people involved organizing makes the **group** more sustainable. It's also good for the **individual volunteers** -- the more involved people are, the more they'll feel affiliation and pride and ownership for the group.

## Common Concerns

Every time I talk about all this, I get these two questions in particular:

> Doesn't it take time to coordinate between people??

Yes, it does take time to coordinate with folks. But it will be less time OVER time as more people get involved and feel more ownership of the group! Delegating tasks/ownership is a longer-term sustainability move, not a short-term optimization.

> What about people who aren't reliable??

Trust is earned over time. If you're concerned, you can give newer folks less responsibility to start, and more responsibility over time. For example: once someone shows they are a reliable front-door welcomer, then maybe next time you can ask them to pick up the coffee. Once they are reliable at picking up coffee, then next time maybe you ask them to run the introduction/announcements, etc.

## Task Sign-Up

Volunteers love to pick up small, discrete tasks -- especially when there are also instructions! I like to track these small, bite-sized tasks in a Google Doc or Trello board.

In Google Docs, I like to link to instruction docs from the center column. On Trello, I keep instructions inside the cards themselves.

![Google Doc sign-up list - a table with a row for each task, and columns for task title, description, and who is assigned to it.](/assets/images/2023-05-01-google-doc-signup.png)

![Trello board with event tasks in columns: way before the event, right before the event, during the event, after the event](/assets/images/2023-05-01-trello-board.png)

People are especially likely to sign up to tasks when you share a **screenshot** of a half-filled doc/board. (Did you notice the "assign yourself" blocks in the Google Doc one?)

_Note: delegating **tasks** to volunteers like this is very different from delegating **ownership** to other organizers -- but that's a topic for a different post!_

## Delegation: The Three "Point Person" Roles

We need somebody to make sure those tasks get done! There are three "point person" roles:

1. **Primary** event point person - responsible for making sure things happen
2. **Secondary** event point person - backup/support person
3. **Venue** point person - not necessarily affiliated with the meetup group, just the space

For example, at a recent [DC Product and Pastries](https://www.meetup.com/product-and-pastries/) event, we had:

1. Rebeccah as the **primary** event point person - Rebeccah covered most of the work from the checklist
2. Casey as the **secondary** event point person - Rebeccah couldn't make it in-person, so Casey did in-person announcements (and this was stressless, because Casey was the secondary and ready to step up!)
3. Eugene Kim as the **venue** point person - he works for [Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com/), our venue. He helped us get people into the venue, setting up the space, etc

### Primary

A **primary point person** is responsible for making sure things happen, but they are NOT responsible for doing all the things. This role is better as a coordinator than as a "do it all" person. They do fill in the gap of things that others don't pick up, but more as a backup. In fact, if the primary point person does NONE of the checklist items themselves, that's great! The more you can delegate, the better (for sustainability/inclusion).

### Secondary

The **secondary point person** is easy to overlook, but it's super helpful in a few ways:

1. **Backup.** In case the primary person gets sick or otherwise can't make it to the event, this person has all the context needed to keep it going (without stress!)
2. **Buddy.** The primary person has a buddy to work with, asking questions or working on things as a pair. This addresses the most common concern I hear from new volunteers: "I don't want to do things alone." Thanks to this primary/secondary setup, no-one has to be alone!
3. **Mentor.** When a newer organizer is willing to take point, it's a good idea to pair them up with an experienced organizer as the secondary person.

### Venue

The **venue point person** is totally distinct from the other two.

Many groups don't make this distinction: the main community organizer happens to work for the main venue, and they are filling both roles. When someone like that leaves the company, often the entire group gets shut down! This is a classic "putting all your eggs in one basket" situation.

Instead, we can split the responsibilities between the venue (being responsible for the space) and the community organizers (who DON'T work for the venue). In this situation, the group will much more easily survive when that person leaves that company.

It's also way easier to find venues when your group treats this as a separate role, too! There are SO many venues that would be happy to let you use their space if you approach saying that your community-led group would cover all the other event responsibilities.

If you think of the **venue** point person role as distinct, you'll be much more sustainable and resilient. It also helps distinguish the community group as [community-led and not company-led](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led).

## Tracking Who's On Point

I like to keep track of who is on point for each event over time using a spreadsheet like this:

![Spreadsheet showing the primary, secondary, and venue person for each event](/assets/images/2023-05-01-point-person-spreadsheet.png)

Tracking these roles helps in a bunch of ways:

- you'll notice much earlier when you'll need more support for an event (or need to cancel)
- you'll remember to distinguish between the roles (primary, secondary, and venue)
- you'll notice more easily when somebody is the primary too many weeks in a row
- you'll notice more easily when you miss having a secondary person

## Takeaways

**New to organizing events?** I hope you've got a clearer picture of what goes into running an event! Especially what things you can delegate.

**Experienced organizer?** I hope you'll consider upgrading your organizing workflow! Many of your members would love to help, if you can set them up for success.
