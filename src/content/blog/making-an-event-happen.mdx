Are you an **experienced organizer**? When you ask for help running events, people often ask "what would that entail?" -- you can send them this post for some background!

Are you a **newer volunteer or organizer**? Thank you for considering being a point person for an event! We need people like you for our communities to thrive. I do my best to clarify what it looks like to be point person for an event.

For this post I'm assuming your community group is community-focused and [community-led](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led). If your group is more of a marketing tool for a company, the advice here may not apply.

## Making An Event Happen (Tasks)

What goes into making a local community event happen? At a high level, there are three parts: 1. venue, 2. event marketing, and 3. running the event. Here is the checklist I use for my events:

- **1. Venue**
  - [ ] getting / confirming a venue
- **2. Event Marketing**
  - Creating The Event
    - [ ] writing an [event description](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/making-event-descriptions-welcoming/) (e.g. Google Docs)
    - [ ] creating an online event page (e.g. Meetup.com)
  - Spreading The Word
    - [ ] Social Media: Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
    - [ ] Online Communities: Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups, Reddit (note: try [authentic marketing](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/authentic-event-marketing/))
    - [ ] Word of Mouth: telling friends; getting members to tell friends
- **3. Running The Event**
  - Before
    - [ ] food: pre-order food/coffee/snacks
    - [ ] signs: print signs (welcome, bathrooms, wifi)
    - [ ] announcements: preparing an intro script / agenda
    - [ ] coordinating: with the venue, speakers, etc
  - During
    - [ ] food: coffee, snacks, etc
    - [ ] signs: putting up signs, etc
    - [ ] announcements: intro announcements / event framing
    - [ ] welcoming folks at the door
    - [ ] answering questions
  - After
    - [ ] clean up the space
    - [ ] set up next event

## Spreading The Load

That list above is a lot for one person to do on their own!! Especially to do over and over, every time you have an event. Solo organizers are implicitly responsible for everything.

If you want your group to be more sustianable and inclusive? Then you must divvy up these responsibilities. Many of these responsibilities I listed above are ones that can be easily moved to another person. I call these easily-movable responsibility sets "hats."

For example, the person spreading the word on **social media** could be a totally different person from the person spreading the word in **online communities**. The messaging style for the two is different, and it can be a different headspace. I've seen many groups naturally divvy up these two. These are different "hats"!

Some groups will have a "spread the word" person who wears both hats at once, and that's okay. But you _could_ divvy up those hats to more people if interest or availability line up that way.

## Why Spread The Load

Not only is this less burden on that one person, it's also healthy for the group! Getting more people involved also helps make the group more sustainable. The more involved people are, the more they'll feel affiliation and pride and ownership for the group.

> Doesn't it take time to coordinate between people??

Yes, it does take time to coordinate with folks. But it will be less time OVER time as more people get involved and feel more ownership of the group! It is a longer-term sustainability move, not a short-term optimization.

> What about people who aren't reliable??

Trust is earned over time! You can give newer folks less responsibility to start, and more responsibility over time. For example: if someone is a reliable front-door welcomer, then maybe next time you can ask them to pick up the coffee. If they are reliable at picking up coffee, then next time maybe you ask them to run the introduction announcements, etc.

## Task Sign-Up

Volunteers love to pick up small, discrete tasks -- especially when there are also instructions! I like to track these small, bite-sized tasks in a Google Doc or Trello board:

![Google Doc sign-up list - a table with a row for each task, and columns for task title, description, and who is assigned to it.](/assets/images/2023-05-01-google-doc-signup.png)

![Trello board with event tasks in columns: way before the event, right before the event, during the event, after the event](/assets/images/2023-05-01-trello-board.png)

People are especially likely to sign up when you share a **screenshot** of a half-filled doc/board. (Did you notice the "assign yourself" blocks in the Google Doc one?? hah)

_Note: delegating **tasks** to volunteers like this is very different from delegating **ownership** to other organizers -- but that's a topic for a different post!_

## Delegation: The Three "Point Person" Roles

We need somebody to make sure those tasks get done! There are three "point person" roles:

1. **Primary** event point person - responsible for making sure things happen
2. **Secondary** event point person - backup/support person
3. **Venue** point person - not necessarily affiliated with the meetup group, just the space

For example, at a recent [DC Product and Pastries](https://www.meetup.com/product-and-pastries/) event, we had:

1. Rebeccah as the primary point person - Rebeccah covered most of the work from the checklist
2. Casey as the secondary point person - Rebeccah couldn't make it in-person, so Casey did in-person announcements (and this was stressless, because we knew Casey would be backup!)
3. Eugene Kim as the venue point person - he works for [Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com/), our venue. He helped us get people into the venue, setting up the space, etc

### Primary

A **primary point person** is responsible for making sure things happen, but is NOT responsible for doing all the things. This role is better as a coordinator than as a "do it all" person. They do fill in the gap of things that others don't pick up, but more as a backup. The primary person does not necessarily have to do ANY of the checklist items -- you can get someone else to write the event description, to post to social media, or make announcements in-person. The more you can delegate, the better.

### Secondary

The **secondary point person** is helpful in a few ways:

1. **Backup.** In case the primary person gets sick or otherwise can't make it, this person has the context needed to keep it going (without stress!)
2. **Buddy.** The primary person has a buddy to work with, asking questions or working on things as a pair. This addresses the most common concern I hear from new volunteers: "I don't want to do things alone." Thanks to this primary/secondary setup, no-one has to be alone!
3. **Mentor.** When a newer organizer is willing to take point, it's a good idea to pair them up with an experienced organizer as the secondary person.

### Venue

The **venue point person** is totally distinct from the other two. Sometimes one person can do both, but that should be the exception more than the rule.

Why distinguish this one here? If we don't name this, we could fall into a trap!

For many groups, when they lose a core organizer, the entire group could be shut down. This happens when a venue point person is also the primary event point person, and THAT person leaves. It's high-risk to have so much responsibility resting on a single person. This happens a lot! It's natural for one person to accidentally end up with all of these responsibilities.

On the flip side, if you distinguish this venue role, that helps a lot! There are SO many venues that would provide a venue point person if your group could cover the other responsibilities. Easily 10x as many venues that would like to JUST be your venue.

If you keep this venue point person role distinct, you'll be more sustainable, resilient, and have way more venue options.

## Who's On Point?

I like to keep track of who is on point for each event over time using a spreadsheet like this:

![Spreadsheet showing the primary, secondary, and venue person for each event](/assets/images/2023-05-01-point-person-spreadsheet.png)

Tracking these roles helps in a bunch of ways:

- you'll notice much earlier when you'll need more support for an event (or need to cancel)
- you'll remember to distinguish between the roles (primary, secondary, and venue)
- you'll notice more easily when somebody is the primary too many weeks in a row
- you'll notice more easily when you miss having a secondary person

## Takeaways

**New to organizing events?** I hope you've got a clearer picture of what goes into running an event! Especially what things you can delegate.

**Experienced organizer?** I hope you'll consider upgrading your organizing workflow! Many of your members would love to help, if you can set them up for success.
