Are you a **newer volunteer or organizer**? Thank you for helping run an event! We need people like you for our communities to thrive.

Are you an **experienced organizer**? Whenever you ask for help, people probably ask you "what would that entail?" -- hopefully this article makes it easier for you to answer that question.

For this post I'm **assuming** your community group is community-focused and [community-led](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led). If your group is instead more of a marketing tool for a company, the advice here may not apply.

## Overview

This post includes:

1. A **checklist** of what it takes to make an event happen
2. **Divvying up** tasks, so you aren't organizing alone
3. **Common concerns** about delegating
4. Making it easy for volunteers to **sign up** for tasks

## Making An Event Happen (Checklist)

What goes into making a local community event happen?

At a minimum you have to do some:

1. **Planning**: Decide the who, what, when, where.
2. **Marketing**: Tell people about it.
3. **Hosting**: Show up, and have the event!

Practically though, there's a little more to it than that. Here is my fuller, more realistic checklist:

- **1. Venue**
  - [ ] getting / confirming a venue
- **2. Event Marketing**
  - Creating The Event
    - [ ] writing an event description, e.g. Google Docs<br />read: _[what to put in your event description?](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/making-event-descriptions-welcoming/)_
    - [ ] creating an online event page, e.g. Meetup.com
  - Spreading The Word
    - [ ] Social Media: Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
    - [ ] Online Communities: Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups, Reddit<br/ >read: _[authentic marketing](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/authentic-event-marketing/)_
    - [ ] Word of Mouth: telling friends; getting members to tell friends
- **3. Running The Event**
  - Before
    - [ ] food: pre-order food/coffee/snacks
    - [ ] signs: print signs (welcome, bathrooms, wifi)
    - [ ] announcements: preparing an intro script / agenda
    - [ ] coordinating: with the venue, speakers, etc
  - During
    - [ ] food: coffee, snacks, etc
    - [ ] signs: putting up signs, etc
    - [ ] announcements: intro announcements / event framing
    - [ ] welcoming folks at the door
    - [ ] answering questions
  - After
    - [ ] clean up the space
    - [ ] set up next event

## Divvying Up Tasks (Hats)

That list above is a lot for one person to do on their own!! Especially to do over and over, every time you have an event.

Solo organizers are implicitly responsible for everything -- and that's not great for sustainability and inclusion. To be more sustainable and inclusive, you must **divvy up** these responsibilities. The responsibilities I listed above in the checklist are already divvied up! Each task could be be done by a different person, and that would still make sense.

I call any easily-movable responsibility-set a **hat** (as in, "someone who wears many hats"). For example, many groups divvy up "spreading the word" about an event into two separate task groups: **social media** separate from **online communities**. Often different people are willing to do these. It's a different headspace, and the messaging style for these are very different. These are different "hats"!

Sometimes one person wears all of the related hats in a section, and that's okay -- but it's even better if we can harness the power of the group! We can get more people involved by tailoring these tasks to the interest and availability of our people. This is easier when we're mentally ready to **split tasks** into hats (more in the Task Sign-Up section in a bit!).

Not only is this less work for that previously-solo-organizer, it's also healthier for the group! Getting more people involved organizing makes the **group** more sustainable. It's also good for the **individual volunteers** -- the more involved people are, the more they'll feel affiliation and pride and ownership for the group.

## Common Concerns

I always get these two questions in particular:

> Doesn't it take time to coordinate people??

Yes, it does take time to coordinate with folks. But it will be less time OVER time as more people get involved and feel more ownership. This delegation is a longer-term sustainability move, not a shorter-term optimization.

> What about people who aren't reliable??

Trust is earned over time. If you're concerned, you can give newer folks less responsibility to start, and more responsibility over time. For example: once someone shows they are a reliable front-door welcomer, then maybe next time you can ask them to pick up the coffee. Once they are reliable at picking up coffee, then next time maybe you ask them to run the introduction/announcements, etc.

## Task Assignment

The simplest way to coordinate task sign-up is in your head. You can keep a list yourself wherever you keep lists, ask people for help individually, and try to remember who's doing what in your head. Here's a version of my checklist above, but in a Google Doc:

## Task SELF-Assignment

You can do even better by sharing your task list in a tool where people can **see what needs doing** and **self-assign**. Some factors that make this work better:

- Task Shape
  - [ ] the tasks are **small and discrete** (because they want to know what they're signing up for)
  - [ ] the tasks have **instructions** or clear support from someone (because they don't want to do it wrong)
  - [ ] the tasks are aligned with **well-known group goals** (like "making first-timers feel welcome")
  - [ ] the tasks matter -- there will be **repercussions** if the task isn't picked up (will the event be cancelled?)
- Making The Ask
  - [ ] **some tasks claimed already** (because people avoid being first)
  - [ ] share a **screenshot** of the sign-up list (because people often don't click links)
  - [ ] most important: you ask people **publicly** (in person, by email, in Slack) **AND privately/individually** (in person, email, messaging)

Two examples of tools I've used for self-assignment: Google Docs and Trello.

### Google Docs Sign-Up

I like using their relatively new [drop-down fields](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10710316?hl=en)) feature

![Google Doc sign-up list - a table with a row for each task, and columns for task title, description, and who is assigned to it.](/assets/images/2023-05-01-google-doc-signup.png)

### Trello Board Sign-Up

I duplicate a board as needed, as a template (even on the free tier)

## Takeaways

1. I hope you have a **clearer image** of what it takes to get an event going!
2. If you're someone who likes to do everything yourself, I hope you'll **consider sharing these responsibilities**, the burden, and the glory with your other group members. Events don't run themselves - but you can get a lot of support!
3. Once you're ready to work on sharing responsibilities, make sure to **include group members** in designing your group's new process/tools -- whether it's Google Docs or Trello, etc.

I hope you become more of a "coordinator" organizer and less of a "do it all" organizer. üëèüèª
