## Why I love Mastodon

1. I get 10x **engagement**, from actual humans! (compared to Twitter)
2. **We own it** ourselves; mega-companies can't trash it.

## The Cycle of Lost Human Connection

Every time we lose an online space it makes me so sad. It's palpable. We're losing human connection! Some examples:

1. Remember when Google bought AIM and Facebook Messenger got popular -- and we all lost the open-protocol chat options? [Trillian](https://www.trillian.im/) used to connect me to 8 of them!
2. Remember when Facebook/Instagram developed "Stories" and everyone left Snapchat?

The newer platforms did also have human connection... but companies have this habit of **corrupting** them.

Companies take these great things that provide real human connection... and then monetize it! Slowly stripping the human connection away and replacing it with ads and "engagement".

Ugh.

Some people call this the "corporate web."

## The IndieWeb: More Resilient

> The [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) is a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web".

With apps like Mastodon we are protected from corporations. They can't exploit us for ad revenue and gradually strip us of actual social connection.

The hard part has been getting enough **critical mass** of adoption for it to be viable.

Thanks to the recent (and ongoing!) Twitter dumpster fire, now is the time for Mastodon!

## Msatodon Terms

Important terms:

- **Mastodon**: a social network like Twitter -- but open source and not owned/run by a mega-company/sycophant.
- **Toot**: a tweet, but on Mastodon
- **Mastodon server**: the website you go to to toot, and where your data is stored (like `gmail.com` vs `hotmail.com` -- mine is `social.coop`)

Nerdy terms you don't really need to know:

- [**The Fediverse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse): A "universe" of "federated," interconnected but independent servers for things like toots, etc.
- [**ActivityPub**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub): A web protocol (like `https://`) that these servers use to talk to each other

## Differences between Twitter and Mastodon

Cons to Twitter

- üóëÔ∏è Twitter's **awful timeline** is run by an algorithm. Lately, 1/30 tweets are someone I follow, and 29/30 are garbage - bad recommendations and ads.
- üí∞ Twitter's algorithm is run for **profit** - ads, engagement. Not human connection.
- üî• If Twitter becomes a dumpster fire... we're kinda **helpless**. Nothing we can do.

Pros to Mastodon

- üôåüèª Mastodon's timeline is full of **humans interacting**!
- ‚ôªÔ∏è If your Mastodon server becomes a dumpster fire, you can **move your account** to another Mastodon server.

## Why do I have to choose a server?

But on Mastodon you have to CHOOSE a server. A lot of people get frustrated at this point and give up. I did at first, too!

If you compare it to Twitter, it's especially complicated... Twitter is so easy, you just sign up on Twitter.com and then you're done!

Instead some people like to compare it to **email servers**, and I like this comparison better!

Mastodon is similar to email in a few ways:

- **Where you log in.** You check your messages on that server
  - `gmail.com` vs `social.coop`
- **Your username.** You choose an "email" or username
  - `first.last@gmail.com` vs `@heycaseywattsup@social.coop`)
- **Other servers.** You can message people from other servers no problem
  - `myfriend@gmail.com` emailed me vs `@theirname@theirserver.com` tooted at me

BUT the metaphor does break down -- there are **SO many Mastodon servers**.

For email, it's super easy to choose a server - most people just choose `gmail.com` and they're done! Beyond gmail, there are ~5 popular email servers at any given time.

Mastodon has THOUSANDS of servers - so it's much harder to choose a Mastodon server.

Luckily, I have some **recommendations** for you!

## Casey's Server Recommendations

I've vetted a bunch of servers for you, and I really like these ones:

- Activism
  - A Cooperative: [social.coop](https://social.coop) (I'm on this one!)
  - Civic Tech: [publicinterest.town](https://publicinterest.town)
- Local
  - DC/MD/VA: [dmv.community](https://dmv.community)
- Tech
  - Ruby language: [ruby.social](https://ruby.social)
  - Open source focus: [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org)
  - General tech: [hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io)

Why these? I considered these three factors:

1. **Admin.** must have admins/moderators that seem organized and reliable
2. **Size.** smaller servers that have better moderation
3. **Topics.** choosing one aligned with your interests, which means you'll have a better local timeline (a minor factor, but it helps you choose!)

## Don't Worry About The Local Timeline

Each server has a different `local timeline`.

But I actually don't use the local timeline that much! I mostly use the "Home" feed, which is a chronological feed of accounts I follow + their boosted toots.

What is a local timeline?

- Your server has a "local timeline" which is roughly "posts anyone on my server has interacted with."
- It's a handy way to see relevant content, especially when you're getting started.
- You can visit any server's "local timeline" even if you aren't a member (check out my server's here: [social.coop](https://social.coop))
- Many Mastodon client apps even let you "visit" these for other servers within the apps. ([Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot-for-mastodon/id1229021451) does)

Your server choice doesn't affect what you see that much at all.

I'm on `social.coop` but I often "visit" the local timeline of other servers (fosstodon.org, ruby.social, hachyderm.io)

## Choosing an App

Just start with the standard [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) app. It's good!

Once you're in, then you can explore the other options.

I'm using [Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot-for-mastodon/id1229021451) on iOS, and it's super cute. My partner [Brian](https://sketchee.com/) is using [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/) on Android. There are a LOT of other apps in development, which is awesome!

But again - just start with the [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) app.

## Finding Twitter friends

Two ways: an app can help, or you can do it manually.

Both ways depend on your friends having their mastodon handle (like `@heycaseywattsup@social.coop`) in their Twitter name or profile.

1. **Apps.** There are a bunch of services that help you find your friends like [Movetodon](https://movetodon.org/) -- but Twitter likes to break these lol.
2. **Manually.** I did it this way. I went through [my followers manually](https://twitter.com/heycaseywattsup/following) and checked their name/profile for handles. Scrolling through it's pretty easy to notice things with two at-signs like `@heycaseywattsup@social.coop`.

## Bonus: Running your own server

I don't really recommend running your own server, at least to start! And probably not ever!

If you do host your own, then you'll have to do maintenance, updates, etc -- you might get distracted from actually enjoying Mastodon.

If I needed my own for some reason (like on behalf of an organization I'm in, etc) I would probably use a "Mastodon Farm" service like [masto.host](https://masto.host/).

## Summary

To get on Mastodon:

1. Sign up to a **server** (maybe one of my recommended ones)
2. Install the standard [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) **app** on your phone.
3. Find some **friends**.
