## Why I love Mastodon

1. I get 10x engagement, from actual humans! (compared to Twitter)
2. We own it ourselves; mega-companies can't trash it.

## The Cycle of Lost Human Connection

Every time we lose an online space it makes me so sad. It's palpable. We're losing human connection! Some examples:

1. Remember when Google bought AIM and Facebook Messenger got popular -- and we all lost the open-protocol chat options? [Trillian](https://www.trillian.im/) used to connect me to 8 of them!
2. Remember when Facebook/Instagram developed "Stories" and everyone left Snapchat?

The newer platforms did also have human connection... but companies have this habit of corrupting them.

Companies take these great things that provide real human connection... and then monetize it! Slowly stripping the human connection away and replacing it with ads and "engagement".

Ugh.

Some people call these the "corporate web."

## The IndieWeb: More Resilient

> The [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) is a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web".

With apps like Mastodon we are protected from corporations. They can't exploit us and gradually strip us of social connections.

The hard part is getting enough critical mass of adoption for it to be viable.

With the recent Twitter dumpster fire, now is the time for Mastodon! üëèüèª

## Msatodon Terms

Important terms:

- [**Mastodon**](https://joinmastodon.org/): a social network like Twitter -- but open source and not owned/run by a mega-company/sycophant.
- **Toot**: a tweet, but on Mastodon
- **Mastodon server**: the website you go to to toot, and where your data is stored (like `gmail.com` vs `hotmail.com` -- mine is `social.coop`)

Nerdy terms you don't really need to know:

- [**The Fediverse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse): A "universe" of "federated," interconnected but independent servers for things like toots, etc.
- [**ActivityPub**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub): A web protocol (like `https://`) that these servers use to talk to each other

## Differences between Twitter and Mastodon

- üöÆ Twitter's timeline is run by an algorithm. Lately, 1/30 tweets are someone I follow, and 29/30 are garbage - bad recommendations and ads.
- üí∞ Twitter's algorithm is run for profit - ads, engagement. Not human connection.
- üßçüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Mastodon's timeline is full of humans interacting!
- üî• If Twitter becomes a dumpster fire... welp, that's that! Nothing we can do.
- ‚è© If your Mastodon server becomes a dumpster fire, you can move your account to another Mastodon server.

## Why do I have to choose a server?

It's easy to sign up to Twitter... you just sign up on Twitter.com, then you were done!

But on Mastodon you have to CHOOSE a server. A lot of people get frustrated at this point and give up. I did at first, too!

People like to compare it to email servers, and I like this comparison!

Mastodon is similar to email in a few ways:

- You check your messages on that server
  - my email: `gmail.com`
  - my mastodon: `social.coop`
- You choose an "email" or username
  - my email: `first.last@gmail.com`
  - my mastodon: `@heycaseywattsup@social.coop`)
- You can "email" people from other servers, no problem
  - e.g. today I got an email from `myfriend@gmail.com`
  - e.g. today a friend tooted at me from `@theirname@theirserver.com`

BUT the metaphor does break down.

It's very easy to pick an email server -- the frontrunner (gmail) is so popular that many people never even consider other email services. And beyond that, there are ~5 popular email servers at any given time.

But Mastodon has THOUSANDS of servers - so it's MUCH harder to choose a Mastodon server.

Luckily, I have some recommendations for you!

## Casey's Server Recommendations

I've vetted a bunch of servers so you don't have to. I really like these ones:

- Activism
  - A Cooperative: [social.coop](https://social.coop) (I'm on this one!)
  - Civic Tech: [publicinterest.town](https://publicinterest.town)
- Local
  - DC/MD/VA: [dmv.community](https://dmv.community)
- Tech
  - Ruby language: [ruby.social](https://ruby.social)
  - Open source focus: [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org)
  - General tech: [hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io)

Why these? I considered these three factors:

1. must have admins/moderators that seem organized and reliable
2. smaller servers that have better moderation
3. choosing one aligned with your interests, which means you'll have a better local timeline (a minor factor, but it helps you choose!)

## Don't Worry About The Local Timeline

I actually don't use the local timeline that much! I mostly use the "Home" feed, which is a chronological feed of accounts I follow + their boosted toots.

What's the local timeline though? Here's a bit more context:

- Your server has a "local timeline" which is roughly "posts anyone on my server has interacted with."
- It's a handy way to see relevant content, especially when you're getting started.
- You can visit any server's "local timeline" even if you aren't a member (check out my server's here: [social.coop](https://social.coop))
- Many Mastodon client apps even let you "visit" these for other servers within the apps

Your server choice doesn't affect what you see that much at all. I'm on `social.coop` but I often "visit" the local timeline of other servers (fosstodon.org, ruby.social, hachyderm.io)

## Choosing an App

Just start with the standard [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) app. It's good!

Explore other options later. I'm using [Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot-for-mastodon/id1229021451) on iOS, and it's super cute. My partner [Brian](https://sketchee.com/) is using [Fedilab](https://fedilab.app/). There are a LOT of other apps in development, which is awesome!

But again - just start with the [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) app.

## Finding Twitter friends

Two ways: an app can help, or you can do it manually.

Both ways depend on your friends having their mastodon handle (like `@heycaseywattsup@social.coop` for me) in their Twitter name or profile.

1. **Apps.** There are a bunch of services that help you find your friends like [Movetodon](https://movetodon.org/) -- but Twitter likes to break these lol.
2. **Manually.** I did it this way. I went through [my followers manually](https://twitter.com/heycaseywattsup/following) and checked their name/profile for handles. Scrolling through it's pretty easy to notice things with two at-signs like `@heycaseywattsup@social.coop`.

## Bonus: Running your own server

I don't really recommend running your own server!

At least for most people -- because then you'll have to do maintenance, updates, etc.

If I did have to host one for some reason (like for a big organization I'm in, etc) I would use a "Mastodon Farm" service like [masto.host](https://masto.host/).

## Summary

To get on Mastodon:

1. Sign up to a server (maybe one of my recommended ones)
2. Install the standard [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) app on your phone.
3.
