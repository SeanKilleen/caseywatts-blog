Are you an **experienced organizer**? When you ask for help running events, people often ask "what would that entail?" -- you can send them this post for some background!

Are you a **newer volunteer or organizer**? Thank you for considering being a point person for an event! We need people like you for our communities to thrive. I do my best to clarify what it looks like to be point person for an event.

For this post I'm assuming your community group is community-focused and [community-led](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led). If your group is more of a marketing tool for a company, the advice here may not apply.

## Making An Event Happen (Tasks)

What goes into making a localc ommunity event happen? At a high level, there are three parts: 1. venue, 2. event marketing, and 3. running the event. Here is the checklist I use for my events:

- **1. Venue**
  - [ ] getting / confirming a venue
- **2. Event Marketing**
  - Creating The Event
    - [ ] writing an [event description](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/making-event-descriptions-welcoming/) (e.g. Google Docs)
    - [ ] creating an online event page (e.g. Meetup.com)
  - Spreading The Word
    - [ ] Social Media: Mastodon, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
    - [ ] Online Communities: Slack, Discord, Facebook Groups, Reddit (note: try [authentic marketing](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/authentic-event-marketing/))
    - [ ] Word of Mouth: telling friends; getting members to tell friends
- **3. Running The Event**
  - Before
    - [ ] food: pre-order food/coffee/snacks
    - [ ] signs: print signs (welcome, bathrooms, wifi)
    - [ ] announcements: preparing an intro script / agenda
    - [ ] coordinating: with the venue, speakers, etc
  - During
    - [ ] food: coffee, snacks, etc
    - [ ] signs: putting up signs, etc
    - [ ] announcements: intro announcements / event framing
    - [ ] welcoming folks at the door
    - [ ] answering questions
  - After
    - [ ] clean up the space
    - [ ] set up next event

## Spreading The Load

That list above is a lot for one person to do on their own!! Especially to do over and over, every time you have an event. Solo organizers are implicitly responsible for everything.

If you want your group to be more sustianable and inclusive? Then you must divvy up these responsibilities. Many of these responsibilities I listed above are ones that can be easily moved to another person. I call these easily-movable responsibility sets "hats."

For example, the person spreading the word on **social media** could be a totally different person from the person spreading the word in **online communities**. The messaging style for the two is different, and it can be a different headspace. I've seen many groups naturally divvy up these two. These are different "hats"!

Some groups will have a "spread the word" person who wears both hats at once, and that's okay. But you _could_ divvy up those hats to more people if interest or availability line up that way.

## Why Spread The Load

Not only is this less burden on that one person, it's also healthy for the group! Getting more people involved also helps make the group more sustainable. The more involved people are, the more they'll feel affiliation and pride and ownership for the group.

> Doesn't it take time to coordinate between people??

Yes, it does take time to coordinate with folks. But it will be less time OVER time as more people get involved and feel more ownership of the group! It is a longer-term sustainability move, not a short-term optimization.

> What about people who aren't reliable??

Trust is earned over time! You can give newer folks less responsibility to start, and more responsibility over time. For example: if someone is a reliable front-door welcomer, then maybe next time you can ask them to pick up the coffee. If they are reliable at picking up coffee, then next time maybe you ask them to run the introduction announcements, etc.

## The Three "Point Person" Roles

There are three hats for event point people:

1. **Primary** event point person - responsible for making sure things happen
2. **Secondary** event point person - backup/support person
3. **Venue** point person - not necessarily affiliated with the meetup group, just the space

For example, at a recent [DC Product and Pastries](https://www.meetup.com/product-and-pastries/) event, we had:

1. Rebeccah as the primary point person - Rebeccah covered most of the work from the checklist
2. Casey as the secondary point person - Rebeccah couldn't make it in-person, so Casey did in-person announcements (and this was stressless, because we knew Casey would be backup!)
3. Eugene Kim as the venue point person - he works for [Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com/), our venue. He helped us get people into the venue, setting up the space, etc

A **primary point person** is responsible for making sure things happen, but is NOT responsible for doing all the things. This role is better as a coordinator than as a "do it all" person. They do fill in the gap of things that others don't pick up, but more as a backup.

The **secondary point person** is helpful in a few ways:

1. in case the primary person gets sick or otherwise can't make it, this person has the context needed to keep it going (without stress!)
2. The primary person has a buddy to work with, asking questions or working on things as a pair. This addresses the most common concern I hear from new volunteers: "I don't want to do things alone." Thanks to this primary/secondary setup, no-one has to be alone!

The **venue point person** is totally distinct from the others. There is a common trap that groups fall into if you don't distinguish this: many groups stop meeting entirely when they lose a core organizer who was also their venue point person. This happens because of how natural it is to put the work of all three roles onto one person -- but that's not resilient or sustainable. There are SO many venues that would provide a venue point person if your group could cover the other responsibilities -- easily 10x as many. You'll be more sustainable, resilient, and have way more venue options if you can structure your group to have the venue point person as a separate role.

It can sound like a LOT of work to run an event, especially if you haven't done one before. It does get easier with time, but there is an even powerful secret than just experience: **asking for help**.
