## Ice Cream

Imagine you're offering a friend some ice cream... and they respond like this:

<PhoneVertical>
  <PersonB>Do you want some ice cream? 🍦</PersonB>
  <PersonA>Well, I do want ice cream because it is delicious.</PersonA>
  <PersonA>But I don't want it because it will make me gain weight</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Do you want some?</PersonB>
  <PersonA>...what kind is it?</PersonA>
  <PersonB>mint chip</PersonB>
  <PersonA>ooh I love mint chip</PersonA>
  <PersonB>**...so do you want some or not??**</PersonB>
  <PersonA>umm....</PersonA>
  <PersonA>yes. Thank you!</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Okay!</PersonB>
</PhoneVertical>

What's going on?

They are being **paradoxical**: they shared one reason TO have it, and one reason NOT to have it.

They're having trouble deciding! You can see their gears turning ⚙️. They are externalizing their thought process, while resolving this inner paradox of theirs.

Sometimes ice cream is a hard decision.

Thankfully, we can get better at talking about the nuances here.

## Discussing the Paradox

At a high level, that ice cream friend was saying:

> 🤔 I do, but I don't

Here's how I'd say that:

> 💚🙅🏻👍🏻 I really **want** it, but I also kinda **diswant** it. I guess overall I **net-want** it.

Here's how I define these terms:

- **Wants** = a factor that makes me want it
- **Diswants** = a factor that makes me not want it
- **Net-want** = my overall decision, based on my wants and diswants.

And here's how I visualize them:

![A visualitazion showing how much something is wanted (green, above line), diswanted (red, below line), and net-wanted (purple line). This one shows a net-want that is positive.](/assets/Wants_Diswants@2x.png)

- **Wants** = green bars above the line
- **Diswants** = red bars below the line
- **Net-want** = The blue line, which is the average of wants and diswants.

Coloquially, want and net-want are often synonyms... except when they're not!

## Want vs Net-want

Have you ever heard someone say this?

> 🤔 It's not that I don't WANT to help, it's just that...

This seems contradictory! They're saying the want to, but clearly they don't want to.

> ⁉️ I (net-)want to, but I don't (net-)want to.

But digging into the nuances, we can figure out what they really mean:

![A visualitazion showing how much something is wanted (green, above line), diswanted (red, below line), and net-wanted (purple line). This one shows a net-want that is negative (a net-diswant)](/assets/Wants_Diswants_2@2x.png)

- they **want** to help some amount
- they **diswant** to help some amount
- overall, they don't want to help -- or: they don't **net-want** to help

## Examples of using the terms?

These terms can be a bit clunky -- here are some ways I've gotten them to work:

> I **want** the ice cream some, because it is delicious.
>
> But I had some yesterday, so I **want** it less than usual.
>
> I really **diswant** the part where I might gain weight.
>
> Overall, I'll pass. I don't **net-want** the ice cream today.

## How does this nuance help?

Two ways this might help you out:

- Hopefully this helps you **understand yourself** better, and now you can see more of the gears turning in your mind with more clarity.
- Hopefully this helps you **understand friends** better -- especially your slow-calculating friends. You'll have an easier time talking about wants and diswants with them, and maybe be more patient with them when they're "calculating".

## Homework

The next time you find yourself saying "I do, but I don't":

- Try to break it down into positive (want) components and negative (diswant) components.
- It's okay if you have positive factors (wants) that don't match your overall decision (net-want).

Good luck articulating your experiences! 🎉
