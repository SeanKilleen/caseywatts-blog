## Ice Cream

Imagine you're offering a friend some ice cream... and they respond like this:

<PhoneVertical>
  <PersonB>Do you want some ice cream? 🍦</PersonB>
  <PersonA>Well, I do want ice cream because it is delicious.</PersonA>
  <PersonA>But I don't want it because it will make me gain weight</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Do you want some?</PersonB>
  <PersonA>...what kind is it?</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Breyer's mint chip</PersonB>
  <PersonA>ooh I love mint chip</PersonA>
  <PersonB>**...so do you want some or not??**</PersonB>
  <PersonA>umm....</PersonA>
  <PersonA>yes. Thank you!</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Okay!</PersonB>
</PhoneVertical>

What's going on?

They are being **paradoxical**: they shared one reason to have it, and one reason NOT to have it.

They're having trouble deciding! Are they trying to be obtuse? Probably not -- it sounds like they just don't know yet. You can see their gears turning ⚙️. They are externalizing their thought process, while resolving this inner paradox of theirs.

Sometimes ice cream is a hard decision.

Thankfully, we can make this easier to talk about!

## Discussing the Paradox

At a high level, that ice cream friend was saying:

> 🤔 I do, but I don't

If we want to dig in, we can do better than that!

Here's how I'd say that, using some more specific terms:

> 💚🙅🏻👍🏻 I really **want** it, but I also kinda **diswant** it. I guess overall I **net-want** it.

Here's a great way to visualize it: your "wants" are above the line (green) and your "diswants" are below the line (red). The average of these two is the blue line, and that shows how much you "net-want" it.

## It's not that I don't WANT to...

Here's a situation where "I do but I don't" is especially unclear at first.

> 🤔 It's not that I don't WANT to help, it's just that...

It might sound like they're contradicting themselves. People usually use the word "want" to mean the concept "net-want." -- so it would be misunderstood as:

> ⁉️ I (net-)want to, but I don't (net-)want to.

But digging into the nuances, we can figure out what they really mean:

- **want** to help: some amount (that's what they're saying)
- **diswant** to help: some amount (they don't say this part as clearly)
- **net-want**: don't want to help overall (mostly implied by their tone)

![A visualitazion showing how much something is wanted (green, above line), diswanted (red, below line), and net-wanted (purple line). This one shows a net-want that is negative (a net-diswant)](/assets/Wants_Diswants_2@2x.png)

## Examples of using the terms?

> I **want** the ice cream because it is delicious
>
> I had some yesterday, so I **want** it less than usual
>
> I **diswant** the part where I might gain weight
>
> Overall, I'll pass. I don't **net-want** the ice cream today.

## How does this help?

Two ways this might help you out:

- Hopefully this helps you **understand yourself** better, and now you can see more of the gears turning in your mind with more clarity.
- Hopefully this helps you **understand friends** better -- especially your slow-calculating friends. You'll have an easier time talking about wants and diswants with them, and maybe be more patient with them when they're "calculating".

## Homework

The next time you find yourself saying "I do, but I don't":

- Try to break it down into positive (want) components and negative (diswant) components.
- It's okay if you have positive factors (wants) that don't match your overall decision (net-want).

Good luck articulating your experiences! 🎉
