## Lot of Questions to Answer!

When someone is considering coming to your event, they have a lot of questions! The more you can answer upfront, the more likely each person is to come.

Do a **self-check**: how many of these are covered in your last event description?

- Title
  - [ ] From the title alone, without context, would someone know what the event was? (I like: group name, event type, location)
- Group Ethos
  - [ ] What is the purpose/values of this group?
  - [ ] Who is this group for?
  - [ ] Who runs the group? (is it [community-led or company led](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led)?)
  - [ ] Is it paid for by a company or sponsors etc?
- Event Details
  - [ ] What will we do there?
  - [ ] Does it cost money?
  - [ ] Covid details? (Ventilation, masks, etc)
- Getting There
  - [ ] Parking? Free/paid?
  - [ ] Public transit?
- Getting In
  - [ ] Once I'm there, how will I get into the building/room?
  - [ ] How will I know when I'm in the right place?
  - [ ] If I come late, how will I get in?
- Getting Involved
  - [ ] Can we talk with others somewhere outside of the event? (Slack/Discord?)
  - [ ] Can people like me get involved organizing/volunteering? How?

## Isn't that a lot?

It's longer than most descriptions, true. But it helps make your group inclusive! My big idea / goal here is to be inclusive of people who would love the event but hesitate to come -- due to fear of parking, uncertainty of what it is, etc.

You do want to make sure it's easy to skim! Headers, bold text, and most important info at the top. The reader can decide if they want to read it all or not -- some people definitely will, and some people definitely won't.

An example should help:

## Example Event Description

Here is one we used for a [Product and Pastries](https://www.meetup.com/product-and-pastries/events/289901721/) event. I'm pretty proud of this event description we wrote together -- some attendees even spontaneously complimented it!

### Event Title

<blockquote>

Product and Pastries - Meet & Greet Social @ La Cosecha (near Union Market)

</blockquote>

### Event Description

<blockquote>

**Who is this meetup group for?**  
**🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑 We’re a Community.** Our attendees feel like they’re a part of the group. This group is not run by a company -- it is run by a group of individual community members.  
**📈🔍 Of Product Managers and Product Designers.** Or for people who work with them, or want to become one.  
**🐣🐓 At Any Level.** Whether you’re aspiring, newer, or more experienced.

We invite anyone working on product development, especially product designers and product managers. You may already be working in one of these roles, or you might be interested in learning more about these roles — either way, you’re welcome!

**What do we do at these events?**  
**💬 Discussion.** Many attendees come with questions, ideas, or strategies to discuss.  
**🕸️ Networking.** Many people come to meet people, that's enough reason on its own.  
**🫲🏻 Support.** Many of our attendees in the past have also found mentors, mentees, and peer-support. We encourage it!

Many people come with questions, ideas or strategies to discuss — and many others just come to meet people! Many of our attendees in the past have also found mentors, mentees, and peer-support friends — and we encourage attendees to form relationships like these.

**What happened to Design and Donuts?**  
With our post-pandy reboot, we are trying out an event that invites both product designers AND product managers — “Product and Pastries”. There is so much overlapping interest with these two groups. We also noticed a need in the DC area for a community-led group for product managers, and we’re happy to pull them into this group. Yay product development!

**What is La Cosecha?**  
La Cosecha is a food court by Union Market. We'll provide some donuts, and you can also buy food, snacks, and drinks in the food court. The arepas are great!

**Join us on Slack!**  
We chat on [DC Tech Slack](https://dctechslack.com/) in the channel #product-and-pastries.

**Interested in Volunteering/Organizing?**  
Interested in helping with these events? We'd love to have you! The more support we have, the more we can (sustainably!) do!!

I hope this helps inspire your own event descriptions to be better! 🎉
