So... you want to be a product manager? (a "PM")

That makes sense to me! It can be a very fulfilling job!

## Where do PMs come from?

In my experience, PMs come from roughly one of three backgrounds:

1. 1/3 come from a **tech** background (like software developer, etc)
2. 1/3 come from a **management** background (like an MBA program, etc)
3. 1/3 come from **other** fields/ backgrounds (education, etc)

And here are many awesome PMs from all of these backgrounds! There is no one best background.

Your background is like your "starting stats," and you'll skill up in these other areas with time.

Your background gives you unique advantages:

- Tech background folks bring more experience **working with developers** and technical limitations
- Management background folks bring more experience focusing on **business value**
- "Other" background folks bring more experience from other domains, including more creative/**lateral thinking**, and bringing in best practices.

It can be hard to value your own advantages! Especially when you're (naturally) very focused on what other people bring and what you "lack". Try to focus on what you uniquely bring -- your background, mindset, motivation, and potential.

## Many Subtypes of PM

You **can't** have every skill maxed out! No PM has all the skills equally developed -- nor should they. I find this concept very comforting: **PMs specialize into subtypes**.

How many types are there, and what are they? That depends on who you ask!

- [The 6 Types of PM](https://medium.com/@kit_ulrich/the-6-types-of-product-managers-which-one-do-you-need-75c2e66dd592) (my favorite one!)
- [The 10 Types of PM](https://casereads.com/10-types-of-product-managers-responsibilities/)
- [The 4 Types of PM](https://productgym.io/the-4-different-types-of-product-managers/)

One thing everyone seems to agree on -- the title "Product Manager" alone does NOT tell you what a given PM is truly responsible for.

Across these though, there are still two areas that I believe are core to the PM role:

1. You are responsible for **prioritizing** (doing what's feasible, imactful, etc)
2. You are responsible for aligning and **motivating** everyone (team members, stakeholders, etc)

As a PM, you **prioritize and motivate**.

## PdM vs PjM

People do generally agree that a Product Manager (with a d) is NOT the same as a Project Manager (with a j). Not the same!

Whoever decided that we would have the same acronym (PM) for both of these roles has cast a _curse_ upon us all. It is SO difficult to communicate about these thanks to this inconvenient acronym overlap.

Here are my simplified definitions:

- Product Manager (PdM)
  - Product Managers come up with what to do **themselves** (within an area of focus / shared vision)
  - Product Managers are responsible for making sure we **do the right thing** (prioritization)
  - Product Managers are responsible for **outcomes** (impact), not outputs (tasks).
- Project Manager (PjM)
  - Project Managers do **what they're told**. They do their best to complete tasks by deadlines.
  - Project Managers are responsible for making sure we **do the thing right** (implementation)
  - Project Managers are responsible for **outputs** (tasks) not outcomes (impact).

I like to abbreviate these to PdM (product) and PjM (project). These distinct acronyms are not super widely used, but they're useful! I define them every time I use them -- but having this clearer verbal "handle" helps us all think about these two distinct roles more clearly.

## When a PM isn't a PM

This PdM vs PjM stuff is all ESPECIALLY confusing given one more wrench: it can be hard to tell who's who!

The title and duties don't always match. The job description may have called this position a "Product Manager," but the "duties as required" part of the job are secretly all Project Management tasks.

I believe this happens for two reasons:

1. It IS inherently **confusing**! PM is a PM right? And some people are somewhere in the middle, partially empowered.
2. It is **virtue signaling**. The company wants to make a less attractive role (PjM) seem more attractive (PdM) and is willing to "pretend" (AND weirdly this might benefit you because people care about titles, but that's another topic)

Over HALF of the "product managers" that I know are essentially project managers in their current role. That's how they're treated by their company. Many of them have even internalized this as "how PMs are supposed to work." And at least in their context, it's true!

Many other product managers in this awkward position try SO hard to be true product managers -- and yet they are thwarted. They are treated like project managers by their company or leadership or peers etc -- all while being told to be a true product manager. This is THE biggest, most common reason for product manager burnout.

## Are you treated as a PdM or PjM?

It is VERY important to figure out how your company treats your role. Are you an empowered PdM, or a disempowered PjM, or somewhere in the middle?

Some example scenarios to illustrate the levels of empowerment:

- Company A: Nobody in particular is responsible for strategy. A roadmap is given to the team by the CEO without much input. The PM is a PjM, just implementing the CEO's vision as micromanaged by the CEO. (full disempowerment)
- Company B: The PM is empowered to come up with their own strategy, and they must also get the team to act on it. They are both PdM and PjM at the same time (alternating maybe). They are tired, and stretched thin. (partial empowerment)
- Company C: The PM is a true PdM, with the ability to prioritize what to work on (within the vision). They work with someone else who does the project management work: a Tech Lead or a junior PM who is effectively a PjM. (full empowerment)

In my experience, roughly 1/3 of companies are in each category: 1/3 disempowered, 1/3 partially empowered, and 1/3 empowered.

We want empowered PMs! For your happiness AND for the company's outcomes to be their most effective.

I hope you can find a company that really empowers you.

## Sanity for PMs

You need peer support no matter what -- but **especially** if you find yourself caught between PdM and PjM expectations pulling you apart. Here are three ways to find more support as a PM:

- **Coworkers.** Make time to talk with PM coworkers one on one (if you're lucky enough to have some!)
- **Community.** Join local meetup groups (like [DC Product and Pastries](https://www.meetup.com/product-and-pastries/))
- **Peers.** Find peers/mentors through your network to check-in with regularly. Many PMs want this sort of support!

## The Trio

Many software development teams have this idea of "the trio" that co-lead the team together:

- A tech lead (developer) focused on what's **feasible**
- A product manager focused on **business value**
- A user experience researcher/designer focused on **user value**

As a PM you'll (hopefully!) spend a lot of time with these peers. You can be a lot of support for each other, and you each have some "pieces of the puzzle" we have to bring together to make the best decisions.

## Product Discovery

There are a ton of named skills PMs use (many PMs don't know the names and that's okay too!).

One high-level idea I want to call out in particular: Product Discovery.

Product Discovery is the process of figuring out what users TRULY need, beyond what they say. Especially when you focus on learning early, figuring it out **early, quickly, and cheaply** -- instead of only learning what they DON'T want after 12 months of expensive software development.

The resources below each cover this big idea, and include many smaller ideas and teachniques that support that.

## PdM Skills

Here are a few of my favorite places to learn more:

- Book [Lean UX](https://leanuxbook.com/) -- an adaptation of The Lean Startup focused on technology companies. When I read this it was "boring" to me because it was everything I was already doing -- which means it's a great book for new PMs! It's the things I find myself doing a lot
- Tools Websites -- My favorite is [PD Methods by NYTimes](https://pdmethods.com/), it has a great description of all of the common techniques I use. Another I like is more general-purpose [Untools.co](https://untools.co/), which has some that PD Methods is missing. One more: when I worked in government, I often referenced [18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/) (so I could say "other parts of the government do this! see!")
- PM Influencers -- Product Management is still so new that a lot of concepts haven't gelled into terminology yet. Sometimes these "PM Influencers" coin terms or come up with great visualizations for things. Three of my favorites: [John Cutler](https://johnpcutler.github.io/tbm2020/) (blog posts), [Shreyas Doshi](https://twitter.com/shreyas) (twitter), and [Jason Knight](https://www.oneknightinproduct.com/) (podcast)
- Peers -- learn from your peers! Start a community of practice at your work, or join a local community group, or an online community.

## A Week in the Life

Okay okay, but what do PMs actually DO? In my opinion/experience, these sorts of things:

- definitely
  - planning with your "trio" (this is your "first team," your most direct teammates)
  - coordinating with stakeholders and other teams (since you have the context)
  - explaining the "why" of the plan; incorporating feedback (to share/get context)
- hopefully
  - attending user interviews (to get context)
  - weekly scrum ceremonies like stand-ups, retros, etc. (to get context)
  - supporting the team (especially developers) as needed (since you have the context)
- maybe
  - writing "stories" which are programming tasks (but other people could do this instead)
  - management of direct reports (but hopefully there are full-time people managers instead)

## Agile Ceremonies

Many companies expect the PM to run every meeting. "After all, manager is in the name!" That's an anti-pattern.

These ceremonies can be done by anyone! And it can even be good experience for people too (it would be rude to deprive others of learning/growth potential!)

Anyone can run standup. Anyone can run a retrospective. Anyone can share-out progress/updates. And many people are interested in this even. Delegate!

## Thank you, Dana

A special thank-you to my PM friend [Dana Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danalee1/) who helped get all of these thoughts out of my head in a "reverse interview." She asked me a bunch of questions which helped me articulate all of these ideas into a coherent narrative. Thank you, Dana!

## You can do it!

I may not know you, but I bet you'll be great as a PM! I believe in you :)

Especially if you can keep the right headspace for this role. Think clearly, communicate clearly, and motivate others to be the most happy and effective PM you can be 👏🏻
