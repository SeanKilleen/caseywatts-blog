  <PersonA>Everyone has cool projects -- I'm feeling inspired to work on my blog again.</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Aww yay! I'm so happy you're into it, too!</PersonB>
  <PersonA>I'm SO into it now.</PersonA>
  <PersonA>and I even got a job lead!! :D</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Awesome! With that big local company?</PersonB>
  <PersonA>Yeah! They seem pretty cool.</PersonA>
  <PersonA>I don't think I would have even applied there before meeting them.</PersonA>
  <PersonA>Can you believe I almost didn't come because of parking? ðŸ˜‚</PersonA>
  <PersonB>lol yeah Baltimore parking is the worst ðŸ˜‚</PersonB>
  <PersonA>I'm so glad the event said which parking lot to use.</PersonA>
