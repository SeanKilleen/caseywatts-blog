Are you someone who would attend a work-topic book club with coworkers? If only there were one -- too bad...

You could set one this up yourself :D

When an employee (individual contributor / IC) sets up an event, I call it "grassroots" -- as opposed to when HR or management set this up.

## Would this be welcomed?

Most teams/managers would celebrate an amount of this! There could be "too much" of this too -- you'll have to feel it out in your org.

As a starting point, I generally recommend doing a bi-weekly discussion. Weekly feels very frequent to people, and monthly loses some of the momentum.

## Why?

Level up yourself:

- carve out this time to spend on your professional development goals for the year
- even just deciding what to focus on learning is powerful
- motivate yourself with accountability
- make space for this, by blocking off the discussion meeting on your calendar

Level up your team and teammates:

- to really change team practices for the better, it helps for the team to all be on-board -- or at least several people

## What to focus on?

The best initiatives like this are driven by what the people in the group want.

An example process for deciding as a group:

1. meet for 30minutes sometime to discuss personal and shared learning goals
   1. try the "think, pair, share" approach: 5min brainstorming solo (the "think"), then discuss 10min in pairs to clarify your thoughts (the "pair", then 15min as a group (the "share")
2. asynchronously have people go off and look for resources to support that goal, to share in a shared Slack channel (etc)
3. choose a date (could be recurring, like every other week) to discuss it.

## How to learn?

Once you know what you want to learn, find a way to learn it -- discussing with peers, reading books/articles, listening to podcasts, watching videos/talks etc. Whatever you choose, you can later discuss it as a group.

- learn from each other -- even just a structured discussion between peers can be a great way to learn
- read a book then talk about it
  - Books can be long -- some groups like to meet multiple times for a book, section by section.
- read an article then talk about it
- watch a video then talk about it
  - Some videos are long, some are short
- listen to a podcast, then talk about it

## Examples

- One team I worked with (developers) would watch a Ruby Tapas episode (video I think?) for 5min, then discuss it each Friday.
- Another team I worked with had an every-other-week "Community of Practice" for Product Managers. We came with ideas to share, resources, challenges, and discussed these together.
