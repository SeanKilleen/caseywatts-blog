## Jekyll Was Fine

I've had my blog on Jekyll for a very long time, but I've never been all that comfortable with it! Some common bumps I always hit:

- **Liquid** is awkward, and I never got the hang of it
- I never found a great way of embedding little **javascript component** widgets (like svelte)
- Whenever I get a new computer I **wrestle with ruby** and bundler versions

## Astro Is Lovely

I've been playing around with other blog/static-site frameworks, and I've decided to try Astro!

There is a lot I like about it:

- It's in **javascript**, which is what I've been using mostly lately (I haven't done ruby full-time in 5+ years)
- I can use my favorite **javascript frameworks**, and even mix them in the same project - Astro supports everything I'd use! Svelte, React, Vue, etc.
- I can put html and javascript components **in my markdown** via MDX -- without needing to use the react part of MDX!
  - (to be fair, I do sometimes use those patterns anyway, but I choose to)
- There are a ton of [**plugins**](https://astro.build/integrations/) already - there's something for just about anything I need!
