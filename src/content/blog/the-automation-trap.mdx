This post is for you if:

- you are a **community organizer/volunteer**
- who **wants to spread the word**
- about your [community-centered events group](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led).

Ugh, repetitive tasks.

As an organizer, I don't particularly enjoy advertising events. It's monotonous to share my event to 10 places every time there's an event. But if I don't, we don't get as many people at the events -- it's important!

It's no wonder so many community organizers reach for **automations** for things like this.

But before you automate a process like "spreading the word" about your event, consider the tradeoffs -- especially when you are sharing things to more intimate community spaces, like Slack or Discord. Automation might have unexpected effects on your community and its goals.

## Two Extreme Examples

Imagine how **different** these two situations feel:

1. Slack Community A (robots): You join this server's `#events` channel. You notice 9 of the past 10 posts were automated by a **bot** that reads rss feeds. On the one human-posted event, someone asked a question -- but **nobody answered them**. There are **no emoji responses** to any posts. You check out an intereresting event, only to see that **nobody has RSVP'd** other than the organizer. You check out the past few events for that group, and see that this is a trend. This events channel feels **dead**. You can't help but feel like this is an ancient civilization, lost to time. What were they like? What was their downfall??
2. Slack Community B (humans): You join this server's `#events` channel. You notice the past 10 posts were made by **humans**. When people ask questions, **they get answers**. Most of the posts **have emoji responses**. When you see an event that looks interesting, you see **30 people RSVP'd** on Meetup.com. This place is really **alive**, and you're feeling excited to meet everyone!

People don't join your Slack/Discord to talk to bots, they join to talk to humans.

People want to join a group that is alive, thriving and ready for new members. That human element is critical.

## Human-Style Writing

How do you share an event in a way that's effective, compelling, authentic, and human?

<ul>
  <CheckboxListItem id="human">Share it as yourself, a **human**, with a name and photo.</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="connection">Share a **personal connection** to the event.</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="this-event">Mention what makes **THIS event** unique.</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="this-group">Tailor it to **THIS group** or person you are sharing it to.</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="respond">When someone asks questions, **respond** (which means monitoring the post).</CheckboxListItem>
</ul>

My favorite trick for writing like a human is to write TO a human. Pick a **specific friend** who might be interested, then draft a text or Slack message or [toot](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/welcome-to-mastodon/) to them. That'll be much closer to being actually authentic!

And whenever you find yourself accidentally writing "marketing zing," ask yourself: "would I send this to a friend?"

> "That sounds nice and all, but it's more work!!"

If you're thinking that that's more work... you're right! It takes time and energy to do this well.

And yet, it's valuable! Here are some reasons why you should spend time to write like a human:

- It signals to people that the group is real, **alive**, caring, ready for new members.
- It signals that this is more likely a **community** and less likely a marketing event or company-led event.
- It shows that the group cares about the **wider community** where it's being shared (not just using as a marketing platform)

## Don't Do It Alone

### Why Include More Humans?

By including more humans in the process of spreading the word, you get a ton of benefits:

- Getting members **more involved** in small ways like this helps them get involved more and in bigger ways - critical to the sustainability of your group.
- Since they're **fresher**, they can often more easily tailor messages (especially if they follow a checklist like above).
- New folks will bring their own **personal connections**.
- **Varying the voice** of who is sharing it looks very good! It signals that the group is a community, and not just run by one person.

### Getting Members To Spread The Word

So HOW do you get your members to do this?

<ul>
  <CheckboxListItem id="shared-goal">Determine if you have a shared goal in the first place (do members WANT to grow the group?)</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="goal">Share that **goal** (e.g. increasing attendance at the next event)</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="why">Share the **why** behind that goal (To help more people? More connections for jobs etc? To justify the venue?)</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="wider-group">Ask the **wider group** several times, in person and online (people will almost volunteer)</CheckboxListItem>
  <CheckboxListItem id="individual">Ask some likely-willing **individuals** privately and politely (this step really works! supported by the earlier steps)</CheckboxListItem>
</ul>

## When TO Automate?

### Some Semi-Automation is Harmless

Some automation is harmless! These can save you time without losing that human element.

- **The details** like date and title and link etc is TOTALLY automatable. If you can get it by copy-pasting that's great! Typing these out manually doesn't add much value. (exception: "this Saturday" etc is very human!)
- A checklist of **where to share** doesn't take away from your ability to tailor the message to each audience.

### Bots in Bot Channels

In Baltimore Tech Slack we're trying out a bot-specific events channel `#meetups-and-events-rss` to post RSS feed entries from Meetup.com. This will not replace our current human-curated `#meetups-and-events` channel.

I was originally against having bots anywhere at all - but some poeple said they would find it valuable! Collectively, we decided to create a separate channel for the bots. We'll get to maintain our human-curated channel that most people prefer, and the people who do want the bots channel can opt-in to that.

Why was I hesitant? Because bots kill channels! The signal-to-noise ratio goes haywire, and it gets worse and worse. It gets automated until all the humans end up leaving or muting or ignoring the channel, leaving it lifeless (like Slack Community A above). If you do add bots to your Slack, **keep them in their own room**.

## Anti-automation Sentiment is Widespread

There are certainly situations where automation helps, but this anti-automation sentiment I'm describing here is pretty strong, lately!

Here's what some of my friends have to say about it:

> ‚ÄúAny communication you can automate, your audience can automatically ignore.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúDon't automate yourself.‚Äù

> "Nobody joins a server to talk to bots."
>
> -- My partner [Brian](https://sketchee.com/)

> "Automated stuff tends to get neglected and break, but not until the damage has been done and all the humans have abandoned the area."
>
> -- [Melissa](https://ruby.social/@holytoastr), [toot](https://ruby.social/@holytoastr/110271574143882174)

I hope you'll be able to avoid letting automation turn your group into a lost civilization. Keep your humanity by being human yourself and by getting more humans involved. üôè
