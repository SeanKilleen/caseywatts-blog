This post is for you if:

- you are a **community organizer/volunteer**
- who **wants to spread the word**
- about your [community-centered events group](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led).

Ugh, repetitive tasks. As an organizer, I don't particularly enjoy advertising events. It's monotonous sharing my event to 10 places every time there's an event. But if I don't, we don't get as many people at the events -- it's important!

It's no wonder so many community organizers reach for **automations** for things like this.

But before you automate a process like "spreading the word" about your event, I want you to first consider the tradeoffs. Visualize what effects that automation might have on your community and its goals.

## The Two Extremes

Imagine how **different** these two situations feel:

1. Slack Community A (robots): You join this server's `#events` channel. You notice 9 of the past 10 posts were automated by a **bot** that reads rss feeds. There are **no emoji responses** to any posts. One the one human-posted event, someone asked a question -- but **nobody answered them**. You check out an intereresting event, only to see that **nobody has RSVP'd** other than the organizer. You check out the past few events for that group, and see that this is a trend. This events channel feels **dead**. You can't help but feel like this is an ancient civilization, lost to time. What were they like? What was their downfall??
2. Slack Community B (humans): You join this server's `#events` channel. You notice the past 10 posts were made by **humans**. Most of them **have emoji responses**. When people ask questions, **they get answers**. When you see an event that looks interesting, you also see **30 people RSVP'd** on Meetup.com. This place is really **alive**, and you're feeling excited to meet everyone!

People don't join your Slack/Discord to talk to bots, they join to talk to humans.

People want to join a group that is alive, thriving and ready for new members. That human element is critical.

## Human-Style Writing

When someone shares an event, what makes that effective, compelling, and human?

- [ ] A **human** (with a name and photo!) shares the event, not a bot.
- [ ] They share a **personal connection** to the event.
- [ ] They mention what makes **THIS event** unique.
- [ ] They frame the event for **THIS group** they are sharing it to.
- [ ] You can ask them questions -- and when you ask, they **respond**.

My favorite trick for writing like a human is to write TO a human. Pick a **specific friend** who might be interested, then draft a text or Slack message or [toot](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/welcome-to-mastodon/) to them. That'll be much closer to being actually authentic!

And whenever you find yourself accidentally writing "marketing zing," ask yourself: "would I send this to a friend?"

> "That sounds nice and all, but it's more work!!"

If you're thinking that, you're right! It takes time, energy, and your human presence to do this well.

Here are some reasons why you should spend time to write like a human:

- It signals to people that the group is real, **alive**, caring, ready for new members.
- It signals that this is more likely a **community** and less likely just a marketing event.
- It shows that group leadership cares about the **wider community** where it's being shared (not just using as a marketing platform)

## Don't Do It Alone

### Why Include More Humans?

By including more humans in the process of spreading the word, you get a ton of benefits:

- Getting members **more involved** in small ways like this helps them get involved more and in bigger ways - critical to the sustainability of your group.
- Since they're **fresher**, they can often more easily tailor messages (especially if they follow a checklist like above).
- New folks will bring their own **personal connections**.
- **Varying the voice** of who is sharing it looks very good! It signals that the group is a community, and not just run by one person.

### Getting Members To Spread The Word

So HOW do you get your members to do this?

- [ ] Determine if you have a shared goal in the first place (do members WANT to grow the group?)
- [ ] Share that **goal** (e.g. increasing attendance at the next event)
- [ ] Share the **why** behind that goal (To help more people? More connections for jobs etc? To justify the venue?)
- [ ] Ask the **wider group** several times, in person and online (people will almost volunteer)
- [ ] Ask some likely-willing **individuals** privately and politely (this step really works! supported by the earlier steps)

## When TO Automate?

### Some Semi-Automation is Harmless

Some automation is harmless! These can save you time without losing that human element.

- **The details** like date and title and link etc is TOTALLY automatable. If you can get it by copy-pasting that's great! Typing these out manually doesn't add much value. (exception: "this Saturday" etc is very human!)
- A checklist of **where to share** doesn't take away from your ability to tailor the message to each audience.

### Bots in Bot Channels

In Baltimore Tech Slack we're trying out a bot-specific events channel `#meetups-and-events-rss` to post RSS feed entries from Meetup.com. This will not replace our current human-curated `#meetups-and-events` channel.

I was originally against having bots anywhere at all - but some poeple said they would find it valuable! Collectively, we decided to create a separate channel for the bots. We'll get to maintain our human-curated channel that most people prefer, and the people who do want the bots channel can opt-in to that.

Why was I hesitant? Because bots kill channels! The signal-to-noise ratio goes haywire, and it gets worse and worse. It gets automated until all the humans end up leaving or muting or ignoring the channel, leaving it lifeless (like Slack Community A above). If you do add bots to your Slack, **keep them in their own room**.

## Anti-automation Sentiment

There are certainly situations where automation helps, but this anti-automation sentiment is pretty strong lately, online!

Here's what some of my friends have to say about it:
