This post is for you if:

- you are a **community organizer/volunteer**
- who **wants to spread the word**
- about your [community-centered events](https://www.happyandeffective.com/blog/community-groups-community-led-vs-company-led).

If you're like me, you do NOT love repetetive tasks like advertising events. Sharing my event to 10 places is so monotonous! It's no wonder so many community organizers reach to **automate** processes like this.

Before you automate a process like "spreading the word" about your event, I want you to first visualize what effects automation might have on your community. Consider the tradeoffs.

## The Two Extremes

Imagine how **different** these two situations feel:

1. Slack Community A (robots): You join this server's `#events` channel. You notice 9 of the past 10 posts were automated by a **bot** that reads rss feeds. There are **no emoji responses** to any posts. One the one human-posted event, someone asked a question -- but **nobody answered them**. You find another event that looks interesting, and see that **nobody has RSVP'd** other than the organizer. You check out their past few events, and see that this is a trend. This channel feels **dead**. You can't help but feel like this is an ancient civilization, lost to time. What were they like? What was their downfall??
2. Slack Community B (humans): You join this server's `#events` channel. You notice the past 10 posts were made by **humans**. Most of them **have emoji-responses**. Some people asked questions about them, and **they got answers**. You find an event that looks interesting, and see **30 people RSVP'd** on Meetup.com. This place is really **alive**, and you're feeling excited to meet everyone!

People don't join your Slack/Discord to talk to bots, they join to talk to humans.

That human element is critical in showing that a group is alive, thriving, and is ready for new members to join and meet people.

## Better Than Automation

### Human-Style Writing

When someone shares an event, what makes it effective, compelling, and human?

- [ ] A **human** (with a name and photo!) shares the event, not a bot.
- [ ] They share a **personal connection** to the event.
- [ ] They mention what makes **THIS event** unique.
- [ ] They frame the event for **THIS group** they are sharing it to.
- [ ] When they are asked a question, they notice and **respond**.

My favorite way to write like a human is to write TO a human. Pick a **specific friend** who might be interested, and draft a text or Slack message or [toot](https://www.caseywatts.com/blog/welcome-to-mastodon/). That'll be much closer to an authentic message!

And if you find yourself accidentally writing "marketing zing," ask yourself: "would I send this to a friend?"

### Yes, It Takes Time

> "That sounds nice and all, but it's more work!!"

If you're thinking that, you're right! It takes time, energy, and your human presence to do this well.

So why do it? Here are some reasons:

- It signals to people that the group is **alive, caring, ready for new members**.
- It shows that someone could **join the community**, and it's not just "marketing content to an audience".
- It shows that group leadership cares about the **wider community** where it's being shared (and not just as a marketing platform)

## Don't Do It Alone

### Why Include More Humans?

By including more humans in the process of spreading the word, you get a ton of benefits:

- New folks are fresh, and **can tailor** messages authentically. They'll bring their own personal connections.
- **Varying the voice** of who is sharing it looks very good! It signals that the group is a collective, and not just run by one person.
- Getting members **more involved** in small ways like this helps them get even more involved - critical to the sustainability of the group.

### Getting Members To Spread The Word

HOW do you get your members to do this? In short:

- [ ] Determine if you have a shared goal in the first place (do members WANT to grow the group?)
- [ ] Share that **goal** (e.g. increasing attendance at the next event)
- [ ] Share the **why** behind that goal (To help more people? More connections for jobs etc? To justify the venue?)
- [ ] Ask the **wider group** several times, in person and online (you'll get some people!)
- [ ] Ask some likely-willing **individuals** privately and politely (this really works!)

## When TO Automate?

### Some Semi-Automation is Harmless

Some automation is harmless! These can save you time without losing that human element.

- **The details** like date and title and link etc is TOTALLY automatable. If you can get it by copy-pasting that's great! Typing these out manually doesn't add much value. (exception: "this Saturday" etc is very human!)
- A checklist of **where to share** doesn't take away from your ability to tailor the message to each audience.

### Bots in Bot Channels

In Baltimore Tech Slack we're trying out a bot-specific events channel `#meetups-and-events-rss` to post RSS feed entries from Meetup.com. This will not replace our current human-curated `#meetups-and-events` channel.

I was originally against having bots anywhere at all - but some poeple said they would find it valuable! Collectively, we decided to create a separate channel for the bots. We'll get to maintain our human-curated channel that most people prefer, and the people who do want the bots channel can opt-in to that.

Why was I hesitant? Because bots kill channels! The signal-to-noise ratio goes haywire, and it gets worse and worse. It gets automated until all the humans end up leaving or muting or ignoring the channel, leaving it lifeless (like Slack Community A above). If you do add bots to your Slack, **keep them in their own room**.

## People Agree!

This "resist bots" theme is pretty prolific! I didn't have to look far to find examples of other people saying the same ideas. Here's what some of my friends have to say about it:

Resist bots. Stay human.
