# Wants, Diswants, and Net-wants

Imagine trying to decide whether to serve your friend some ice cream, and they respond like this:

<PhoneVertical>
  <PersonB>Do you want some ice cream? üç¶</PersonB>
  <PersonA>Well, I do want ice cream because it is delicious.</PersonA>
  <PersonA>But I don't want it because it will make me gain weight</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Do you want some?</PersonB>
  <PersonA>...what kind is it?</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Breyer's mint chip</PersonB>
  <PersonA>ooh I love mint chip</PersonA>
  <PersonB>...so do you want some or not??</PersonB>
  <PersonA>umm....</PersonA>
  <PersonA>yes. Thank you!</PersonA>
  <PersonB>Okay!</PersonB>
</PhoneVertical>

Your friend is having trouble deciding! Their first response (it's delicious / it will make me gain weight) is paradoxical: one reason to serve it, and one reason NOT to serve it.

It's not that your friend is trying to be obtuse. They probably don't know yet! Sometimes ice cream is a hard decision. They are externalizing their thought process while resolving this inner paradox of theirs. You can see their gears turning.

## Resolving the Paradox

If you have a rich understanding of wants and diswants, this exchange can make a lot of sense!

If I were being more direct than your mint chip loving friend, I might say

> I really want it, but I also kinda don't want it, ya know? I guess I do want it. I'll have some, thanks!

I even have my own words for these ideas! Wants, diswants, and net wants.

Using these terms of mine I would say:

> I really want it, but I also kinda diswant it. I guess I net-want it. I'll have some, thanks!

IMAGE OF BAR GRAPHS - SOME BELOW AND RED. SOME ABOVE AND GREEN, OVERALL A PURPLE LINE

This is hard because English gets in the way! We don't have a colloquial way to communicate these ideas.

This pattern happens a lot in English "I do, but I don't"

## Want-factors, diswant-factors

I could even break it down into sub-parts BAR GRAPH BUT WITH MULTIPLE WANT-FACTORS

Here's how I break these down in my head:

- A **want-factor**: I want to eat this ice cream because it is delicious
- A **diswant-factor**: I don't want to eat this ice cream because the extra calories will make me gain weight
- **Overall I want**: I have decided not to eat the ice cream.

Or in shorter terms:

- Want
- Diswant
- Overall want / overall do not want

People do use the word want in this way!

> Please don't misunderstand me, I really do want to help! _proceeds not to help_

They are saying "I want to help, but I diswant to help more. I net-diswant to help."

## Why not just tell me what you want?

Some reasons why this might happen:

1. Saving Face
   1. It doesn't look good to say "no I don't want to help you with this."
2. Still Calculating
   1. I might not know yet! (and if you hear me say the word diswant, I'm calculating it out loud so you get more than a "dialtone" from me lol)
3. Please Understand Me
   1. I want to be understood by people I care about, and I hope you care about me enough to understood me more deeply.

Often I literally don't know what I net-want yet!

> I haven't figured out whether I want the ice cream yet -- could you get back to me in a second?

## X

You might just want to know whether to serve the ice cream

You might also care about the person enough to understand them better! How did you decide? Is it because of the flavor?

People love to feel understood LINK. To communicate that you understand their internal conflict is a gift.

## How is this useful?

For one, it could give you a richer understanding of yourself!

But more focus in this article on: it'll help you understand the paradoxes of others

The English language makes it hard to talk about these nuances of desires.

## Why do people do this?

It seems paradoxical that someone can want to do something and yet not do it. But imagine this:

> "...so should I serve you some or not??"

What they want to know is OVERALL do you want to eat it or not?

But you might want to be clear!

- It's not that you hate mint chip ice cream - you love that flavor!

When the short version goes wrong: "Oh I thought you didn't like mint chip because you said you didn't want it last time" "No it's actually my favorite flavor!! I'm just watching my weight"

THAT is why many people want to tell you they do want something even when they don't overall-want it.
