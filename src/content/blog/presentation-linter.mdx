Casey-style Presentation Linter

EVERY time I ask for feedback on a presentation of mine, somebody suggests one of these 5 big ideas. I need a checklist for myself to make sure I address these -- and you could probably use this, too!

## Presentation pitfalls

Six reasons why your presentation isn't as effective as it could be:

1. People aren't sure why you're presenting (missing **why**)
2. People ARE interested and paying attention, but...
   1. they aren't following what you're sharing (too many **concepts** per slide)
   2. they aren't listening -- they are reading (too many **words** per slide)
   3. they are having trouble visualizing (not enough **visuals** per slide)
   4. they are listening but getting lost (missing "**maps**")
3. Now that you've shared, they aren't sure what to DO with all that. (missing **takeaways**)

## Linting Rules

1. Start with Why
2. One concept per slide
3. One visual per slide
4. No more than 7 words per slide
5. Each collection of 3+ concepts has a "Table of Contents" slide
6. End with Takeaways

## Rule 1: Start with Why

**Problem?**

People have trouble focusing during presentations. SO many presentations we sit through don't feel very relevant to us or important to listen to (even if they ARE related).

**Solution?**

Share the "why". This is THE biggest thing you can do to help people get value out of what you're presenting. Make the "why" very explicit, clear, and obvious. If you can connect what you're sharing to them and their wants/needs/desires, you will have their attention! ‚ú®

**How?**

- Try to think about it - why WOULD someone be interested in this?
- Talk to someone in your target audience. Ask THEM why this might be important to them, in their own words. Write down and use their words.

Description: Every presentation should start with a story that shows "why" this is important -- something that is very easily and directly relatable to your audience.

Why: For people to give you their attention, you have to help them connect the dots to why it's relevant to them. If you make this compelling, they'll absorb what you have to share!

Measure: For each "big concept" in your presentation, what % of them are well-motivated by a story you shared? Goal: 100%

## Rule 2: One concept per slide

DESCRIPTION

Why: People will usually read the slides, and they'll get out of sync with what you're sharing if you have multiple concepts at once. At the extreme, it's literally overwhelming and they shut down listening.

Measure: Count the number of concepts on each slide. What % of your slides have more than ONE concept?

Goal: 0%.

(Exception: the "table of contents" slides in rule D, which you don't spend long on anyway)

## Rule 3: One visual per slide

Description: Ideally every slide has a visual (even if it's just an emoji)

Why: People are much faster at processing visuals than words. Visuals help make the slides distinct.

Measure: What % of slides are text-only, no visuals?

Goal: 0%

## Rule 4: No more than 7 words per slide

Description: DESCRIPTION

Why: If you have more than 7 words, either people read them and don't listen to you (uh oh!) OR people don't read them, and they get ignored (uh oh!)

Measure: What % of your slides have more than 7 words?

Goal: 0%

## Rule 5: "Table of Contents" slides // no orphans

Description: Each collection of 3+ concepts has a "Table of Contents" slide

Why: People get lost during presentations! They need a roadmap to tell what you're about to share, so they're ready to hear it / receive it.

Measure: What % of your slides are "orphans"? i.e. they are similar to their neighbors, but don't have a "parent".

Goal: 0%

## Rule 6: End with Takeaways

TBD
