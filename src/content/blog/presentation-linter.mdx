Casey-style Presentation Linter

EVERY time I ask for feedback on a presentation of mine, somebody suggests one of these 5 big ideas. I need a checklist for myself to make sure I address these -- and you could probably use this, too!

## Linting Rules

1. Start with Why
2. One concept per slide
3. One visual per slide
4. No more than 7 words per slide
5. Each collection of 3+ concepts has a "Table of Contents" slide

## Rule 1: Start with Why

Description: Every presentation should start with a story that shows "why" this is important -- something that is very easily and directly relatable to your audience.

Why: For people to give you their attention, you have to help them connect the dots to why it's relevant to them. If you make this compelling, they'll absorb what you have to share!

Measure: For each "big concept" in your presentation, what % of them are well-motivated by a story you shared?

Goal: 100%

## Rule 2: One concept per slide

DESCRIPTION

Why: People will usually read the slides, and they'll get out of sync with what you're sharing if you have multiple concepts at once. At the extreme, it's literally overwhelming and they shut down listening.

Measure: Count the number of concepts on each slide. What % of your slides have more than ONE concept?

Goal: 0%.

(Exception: the "table of contents" slides in rule D, which you don't spend long on anyway)

## Rule 3: One visual per slide

Description: Ideally every slide has a visual (even if it's just an emoji)

Why: People are much faster at processing visuals than words. Visuals help make the slides distinct.

Measure: What % of slides are text-only, no visuals?

Goal: 0%

## Rule 4: No more than 7 words per slide

Description: DESCRIPTION

Why: If you have more than 7 words, either people read them and don't listen to you (uh oh!) OR people don't read them, and they get ignored (uh oh!)

Measure: What % of your slides have more than 7 words?

Goal: 0%

## Rule 5: "Table of Contents" slides // no orphans

Description: Each collection of 3+ concepts has a "Table of Contents" slide

Why: People get lost during presentations! They need a roadmap to tell what you're about to share, so they're ready to hear it / receive it.

Measure: What % of your slides are "orphans"? i.e. they are similar to their neighbors, but don't have a "parent".

Goal: 0%
