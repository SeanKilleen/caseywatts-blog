# An &quot;Inverted&quot; Resume - Casey and Clara

<span data-m="00000">  <br/>**Casey:** <br/> Hi. I'm Casey! And I'm here with Clara. We're gonna go through Clara's resume preparation. </span>

<span data-m="07000"> I do a lot of career coaching for friends and family</span>

<span data-m="09000"> and friends of friends, and especially in tech. Here are the four stages that I like to do, whether I'm applying to a job or helping someone else.</span>

<span data-m="16000"> I've already done a couple of these with Clara. We're here on step three already. I talked with Clara about &quot;what's important to Clara in a job&quot;</span>

<span data-m="22000"> and &quot;what jobs does she want&quot;, </span>

<span data-m="23000"> and we picked some, we got one that Clara's targeting now. </span>

<span data-m="27000"> And now we wanna make sure that Clara can get through the screening process </span>

<span data-m="29000"> and then the interview is later.</span>

<span data-m="31000"> We're not talking about that today.</span>

<span data-m="33000"> I've got a whole bunch of worksheets.</span>

<span data-m="35000"> So Clara did this worksheet 3B, which I call the &quot;inverted resume&quot;, </span>

<span data-m="38000"> and we'll be going through what Clara did. </span>

<span data-m="41000"> anyway, before we hear more about me </span>

<span data-m="43000"> or we start this actual session itself, let's hear from Clara.</span>

<span data-m="47000">  <br/>**Clara:** <br/> Hi, Um, so I am applying for manager, senior manager, director, roles in program managing. </span>

<span data-m="57000"> I am a public health professional by [00:01:00000"> trade and training, and that's the general area that I wanna work in. Although I do like a lot of other different types of programs. </span>

<span data-m="06000"> I spent a lot of time doing community and grassroots type work, </span>

<span data-m="10000"> and now I'm moving my resume and interest to shift over to more managerial directorship type roles. So here's one that I found. It's a good commuting distance for me. It's a topic area I like. It's a title that I like and the work itself seems to fit very well within what I like to do. I believe that I am one hundred percent qualified for this job, </span>

<span data-m="36000"> so I want to make sure that my resume both reflects what I am qualified to do, </span>

<span data-m="42000"> gives really good solid examples and is easy to read </span>

<span data-m="45000"> and also gives off director, manager, um, attitude. Not really as much Grassroots coordinator attitude is what I was doing before.</span>

<span data-m="55000"> **Casey:** The other day, Clara, you were telling me about this worksheet and how it was <span data-m="00000"> frustrating in a way, </span>
