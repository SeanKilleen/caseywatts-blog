1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:00,269
Casey: Hi.

2
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:01,519
I'm Casey!

3
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:02,709
And I'm here with Clara.

4
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:06,334
We're gonna go through
Clara's resume preparation.

5
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:09,574
I do a lot of career coaching
for friends and family

6
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:11,735
and friends of friends,
and especially in tech.

7
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:14,964
Here are the four stages that I
like to do, whether I'm applying

8
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:16,084
to a job or helping someone else.

9
00:00:16,685 --> 00:00:18,004
I've already done a couple
of these with Clara.

10
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,164
We're here on step three already.

11
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:22,064
I talked with Clara about "what's
important to Clara in a job"

12
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:23,704
and "what jobs does she want",

13
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:26,411
and we picked some, we got one
that Clara's targeting now.

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,656
And now we wanna make sure that Clara
can get through the screening process

15
00:00:30,103 --> 00:00:31,203
and then the interview is later.

16
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:32,403
We're not talking about that today.

17
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:35,048
I've got a whole bunch of worksheets.

18
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:38,568
So Clara did this worksheet 3B,
which I call the "inverted resume",

19
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,808
and we'll be going through what Clara did.

20
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,611
anyway, before we hear more about me

21
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:47,091
or we start this actual session
itself, let's hear from Clara.

22
00:00:47,716 --> 00:00:54,856
Clara: Hi, Um, so I am applying
for manager, senior manager,

23
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,186
director, roles in program managing.

24
00:00:57,926 --> 00:01:02,436
I am a public health professional by
trade and training, and that's the

25
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:03,836
general area that I wanna work in.

26
00:01:04,076 --> 00:01:06,596
Although I do like a lot of other
different types of programs.

27
00:01:06,636 --> 00:01:10,116
I spent a lot of time doing
community and grassroots type work,

28
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:15,196
and now I'm moving my resume and
interest to shift over to more

29
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:18,356
managerial directorship type roles.

30
00:01:18,856 --> 00:01:20,236
So here's one that I found.

31
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,156
It's a good commuting distance for me.

32
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,636
It's a topic area I like.

33
00:01:26,026 --> 00:01:30,676
It's a title that I like and the
work itself seems to fit very

34
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,196
well within what I like to do.

35
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:36,166
I believe that I am one hundred
percent qualified for this job,

36
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:41,966
so I want to make sure that my resume
both reflects what I am qualified to do,

37
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:45,046
gives really good solid
examples and is easy to read

38
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:49,486
and also gives off director,
manager, um, attitude.

39
00:01:49,706 --> 00:01:54,886
Not really as much Grassroots coordinator
attitude is what I was doing before.

40
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,966
Casey: The other day, Clara, you
were telling me about this worksheet

41
00:01:58,046 --> 00:02:01,206
and how it was frustrating in a way,

42
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,631
but really helpful and
good I wanna hear that.

43
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:03,951
Tell us

44
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:07,976
Clara: Yeah, it was frustrating
because the thing is like,

45
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:10,976
I don't know if anybody else
does this, but I do this

46
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:11,976
when I'm making a new resume:

47
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,736
I usually start with the
resume I already have, and

48
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:18,296
I go through and read the whole
thing and I fix it, change it,

49
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:20,416
add in some quantifiable things.

50
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:23,456
I think really hard about all
the functions I did in that job

51
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,176
to make sure I'm giving
myself credit for each thing.

52
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,246
Um, and.

53
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:33,266
The issue I was having is that
I find myself summating a lot

54
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,786
or having lots of
summation, bullet points,

55
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,826
things that give you vague
ideas about what I was doing,

56
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:44,186
but not things that give you concrete
examples or very clear things that

57
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:49,386
anyone who can read it can look at,
grab it, latch onto it, bring it up

58
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:50,986
in interviews and conversation later.

59
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,656
And,  I realized that for
in three different ways:

60
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:59,771
one, after reading or rereading this
worksheet for the inverted resume,

61
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,171
I was like, "okay, uh, I
think I already do that."

62
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:06,611
Like, I was trying to convince
myself that I already, you know, I'm

63
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,251
already addressing what needs to be
addressed for the job description.

64
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:11,691
And I look back at my resume, I'm like,

65
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,571
"I'm kind of embarrassed about this..."

66
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:14,071
Casey: Yeah.

67
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:14,991
Yeah, I do that

68
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,011
Clara: necessarily bad.

69
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:17,531
Yeah.

70
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:20,091
'cause it's like you don't
really think, oh, this is bad.

71
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:20,891
You don't really think that.

72
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:22,441
It's more like a uh,

73
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,801
it's like you look at something
too long, you stop seeing it fully,

74
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:26,646
Casey: Yeah.

75
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,606
We also have what's called
the "curse of knowledge".

76
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:32,006
'cause we know all the
stuff that we've done

77
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,886
and so when we look at our own resume,

78
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:36,526
we're like, "yeah, that,
that one line on line 57

79
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:39,166
of my really dense and
wordy resume that I have,

80
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,086
it's obvious that I'd be
really good at this job.

81
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,186
They, they should know!"

82
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:43,616
But how could know??

83
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:44,816
If it's just one line of the

84
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:45,336
Clara: How could they know?

85
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:46,296
Casey: You really have to design it.

86
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:49,386
Clara: I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8.

87
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:55,506
I have 8 two-line bullet points for each
of the jobs, and that's me paring it down.

88
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:56,746
It's super dense.

89
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:57,826
There's lots of commas.

90
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,946
And I'm just like *sigh*.

91
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,866
I'm embarrassed BECAUSE I know as
someone who's had to read resumes,

92
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:08,666
it's REALLY hard to read that
and pick out anything useful.

93
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:13,826
So I was frustrated because as soon as I
reread my resume, after looking at this.

94
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,896
I was like: "I have to
redo the whole thing"

95
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:18,626
"I have to redo the whole thing ðŸ˜­".

96
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:23,766
It was super frustrating, BUT it was
nice going through this worksheet because

97
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:28,756
sometimes it's hard to sort of access
that creative writing part of my brain,

98
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:32,976
but with the worksheet, it's sort of
like you're asking yourself questions

99
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,016
that you just need to answer, and
that makes it very clear and concise,

100
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:41,016
Casey: these questions, these
questions ARE what the resume-skimming

101
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:43,636
person is asking themselves, right?

102
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:45,366
That's where these questions
came from, and you're writing

103
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:46,686
them, imagining for that person.

104
00:04:46,876 --> 00:04:49,196
Once you wrote them,
then you can answer them.

105
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:56,051
Clara: Yeah, and I'm, I'm not,
sometimes I get into a weird head

106
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,331
space when dealing with resumes.

107
00:04:57,331 --> 00:05:00,291
It's a really unique
document to try to write.

108
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:04,051
So instead of trying to get super
intensified, I just copy and

109
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:07,841
paste important lines and grouped
them together in the topics area.

110
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:12,336
So like -this job description,
talks a lot about managing

111
00:05:12,336 --> 00:05:14,056
internal/external partnerships.

112
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:19,656
So when I saw, I picked out
two or so instances of that.

113
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:25,331
and I just pasted them, like "facilitating
community outreach strategies".

114
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,851
Those external partnerships.

115
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,371
Um, "facilitating meetings
of key partner stakeholders."

116
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,731
That's external partnerships.

117
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:36,771
And so I picked out the, those type
of things, even just the one above it.

118
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:40,726
Uh, "working collaboratively with
internal external partnerships", <LAUGH>

119
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:41,286
partners.

120
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:44,006
So it's like right there.

121
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,926
So I was like, oh, this
is obviously important.

122
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:49,846
So I picked out those three bullet
points and put it under a topic, and

123
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:52,086
then I sat there, I put my resume down,

124
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:53,376
Casey: Yeah.

125
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,056
That's hard.

126
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:54,736
Uhhuh

127
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:56,366
Clara: it's hard.

128
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:57,126
It's so hard.

129
00:05:57,606 --> 00:05:58,566
I sat there and I'm like,

130
00:05:59,316 --> 00:05:59,606
yeah,

131
00:05:59,696 --> 00:06:00,496
Casey: this a different document?

132
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:02,846
Clara: no, that's,
that's the same document.

133
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:05,591
It's not as pretty, but you know, that's,

134
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:06,536
Casey: it's just notes.

135
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,111
Clara: a section...

136
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:08,311
it's just notes!

137
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:13,551
And it's just like, um, I would just
pick up things that seem to go together.

138
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:14,711
Yeah.

139
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:18,551
And I just wrote, and I just
wrote down quick things that

140
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:25,071
came to memory about experiences,
uh, that support those things.

141
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:29,201
like this topic area on researching

142
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:30,921
evidence-based practices.

143
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:35,441
And I was like, okay, well, my whole
master's thesis was about that.

144
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,761
I wrote an entire technical
assistance package for policymakers,

145
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,881
and I literally had that
nowhere on my resume!

146
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:41,981
It's not on my resume.

147
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:42,781
It's not at all.

148
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:43,051
Casey: Ah..

149
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,301
Clara: I didn't even think about that!

150
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,021
And because I,

151
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:48,126
Casey: I've done that a lot too.

152
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,436
Of course, they'll know.

153
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:50,426
But!

154
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:54,521
Clara: Of course they'll realize that the
ONE line that says I have a Master's in

155
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:58,001
public health and Behavioral and Community
Health will let them understand that

156
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,001
I OBVIOUSLY have a working
knowledge of how to convert

157
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:04,721
like information and
evidence research based

158
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,241
into research based
practices and implement them.

159
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,051
Of course, they'll know that ðŸ™„ --nope!

160
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:10,596
Casey: It's funny hearing us say it now.

161
00:07:10,626 --> 00:07:12,416
'cause we have the gift of hindsight now.

162
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,296
So this is funny maybe, but

163
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,736
a lot of people get really stuck
in thinking that their resume

164
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:20,310
is already great, but they don't
know why they're not getting the

165
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,550
interviews that they were hoping for.

166
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,230
Including me, sometimes!

167
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,979
I'm not immune.

168
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,619
I have to do my own process, so that
I'm gonna do that the right way.

169
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,060
It's not like I developed a process
and magically I do it right every time.

170
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,300
I have to remember.

171
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:34,055
To pull out my own worksheets.

172
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:34,315
Clara: how to do

173
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:34,844
Casey: it's not natural.

174
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,894
This isn't like a natural
way to approach it.

175
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:37,695
Clara: No!

176
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:39,594
It's also daunting.

177
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:42,674
It's daunting to think
about redoing your resume

178
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:45,514
'cause you spent so much
time trying to remember,

179
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,674
and I don't know if
you're like me, Casey, but

180
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:50,354
when I'm in a job and I do something
I'm particularly proud of, I jot

181
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,034
it down in like a, like a working

182
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:53,224
document or something

183
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,914
Casey: A "smile file,"
some people call it.

184
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:55,604
I have one of those.

185
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:57,854
Clara: A smile file, success stories,

186
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:58,644
Casey: It's just a Google Doc for me.

187
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:00,604
just one Google Doc that's long now.

188
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:02,715
Clara: Ugh.

189
00:08:02,894 --> 00:08:04,514
But it's, it's good and bad!

190
00:08:04,514 --> 00:08:08,555
Because you, you wanna tell people
how great you are and you're like,

191
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:11,354
"look at all this cool stuff
I know how to do," but that's

192
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,675
not what they're asking about.

193
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:16,354
The resume is like your highlights reel.

194
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:19,004
It's not supposed to be the
hour and a half documentary,

195
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:20,364
Casey: Yep.

196
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:23,815
The hour and a half documentary is the
CV, which most jobs don't even ask for.

197
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,379
Clara: Right.

198
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:29,085
Casey: and if you want can include
a highlights reel attached to a CV.

199
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:29,724
Sometimes I do that.

200
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:31,279
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

201
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:32,934
Casey: some jobs don't
want that, whatever,

202
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,214
you have to read this job description.

203
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:37,655
Some people will send BOTH in to
a job, and it works sometimes,

204
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:39,534
but sometimes it gets disregarded.

205
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:40,254
Whatever, it's...

206
00:08:40,464 --> 00:08:41,494
every company's different.

207
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,534
But yeah, the CV is, is what most
people think of as the resume.

208
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,055
It's closer to the CV idea.

209
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:46,974
Mm-hmm.

210
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:47,689
Clara: Right.

211
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,970
And actually, for some people it's
very hard to distinguish them.

212
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:55,215
Because either you have a lot of
research or published papers and

213
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:58,255
you like wanna bring up all that,
it's can be hard to distinguish.

214
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:02,455
But I still, I'm trying to train
my mind to think about it as,

215
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:03,495
this is your highlights reel.

216
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:04,735
This is the trailer to your movie.

217
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:06,655
They don't need to know
every single thing about you.

218
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:10,615
They need to know, are you going to meet
their qualifications / later standards?

219
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,895
Are you meeting their expectations?

220
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:13,455
Can they pull it out immediately?

221
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:16,295
And that led to me
writing down these notes.

222
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,975
And I had talked to Casey
about this before, but

223
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:21,735
I started this worksheet and I
literally put it away because I was

224
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,055
like, I have to redo everything.

225
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:24,214
Casey: Yeah, yeah.

226
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:25,055
do that.

227
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:25,944
It can be overwhelming.

228
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:26,475
That's human.

229
00:09:26,495 --> 00:09:27,345
Clara: Yeah, yeah.

230
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,705
Because it's, it's totally human.

231
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:31,105
Like even in the same bullet point.

232
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,880
um, asking about evidence-based practices,

233
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,560
things that I didn't even like -- okay.

234
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,560
On here, adjunct instructor.

235
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm an adjunct instructor for
two different universities, and

236
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:43,490
Casey: Mm-Hmm.

237
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,180
Clara: I have that on my resume,
it's on there, but the part the

238
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,740
part where I talk about, like,
I say, oh, I made a curriculum.

239
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,939
I don't say the fact that I use, I did
tons of research, went to literal classes.

240
00:09:56,895 --> 00:10:01,334
Evidence-based practices on how to
teach in a diverse classroom and how

241
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,094
to develop a curriculum so that as
many students as plausible can succeed

242
00:10:05,115 --> 00:10:08,415
and retain the information that you've
given them and use them in real life.

243
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,895
That stuff, I'm like, "Ugh, I didn't,

244
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,775
I didn't exactly represent that," and

245
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,255
I'm like, well, that was
such a dynamic experience.

246
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:17,135
Why didn't I talk about it?

247
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:18,334
I forgot!

248
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:19,845
Casey: Yeah, curse of knowledge too!

249
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,765
And maybe also forgetting,
sure, both, both happen.

250
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:26,004
Clara: No, but I like, I
forget that no one's...

251
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:28,444
not, everyone's gonna read
the same sentence and think

252
00:10:28,444 --> 00:10:30,004
about all those explicit things

253
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,925
that comes to mind when
I think about them.

254
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:32,495
Casey: Yeah.

255
00:10:32,495 --> 00:10:32,735
Yeah.

256
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:37,135
And even if they're, um, screening
- whoever it is, HR, the hiring manager,

257
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,454
whoever's doing the screening - even
if they are really on top of it and

258
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:42,989
they're really thorough and read line
by line and really think about the

259
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,229
depth of the meaning of every line.

260
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:48,829
Like we naively always naturally (me
too) always imagine they'll do for us

261
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,150
give us that benefit of the doubt.

262
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:53,109
Maybe they CAN'T because they
don't have enough of the context

263
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,949
here to know what "teaching as an
adjunct at the university" MEANT.

264
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:56,930
They can't, it's not there.

265
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:58,529
Even if they wanted to be super thorough.

266
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,089
But they're also NOT
super thorough, usually.

267
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:05,819
Me, when I was, doing hiring and
screening people at different companies.

268
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:09,484
Often I'll get a resume, like an
hour before an interview when I'm

269
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:11,564
interviewing someone I'm like,
why didn't I get this sooner?

270
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:15,404
And I skim it real quick and I feel bad
about it, but that's just like the hiring

271
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:16,964
pipeline is very rushed a lot of the time.

272
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:17,884
They're trying to be efficient.

273
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,894
And so knowing some people are like that,
most people, we have to make it SUPER

274
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:27,014
SUPER readable, skimmable so that someone
who's screening candidates, a whole

275
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:30,534
bunch of candidates, they know they need
"research evidence-based practices," that

276
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,974
kind of thing, and they can just open
your resume and look at it and be like,

277
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:34,414
"She's got it; next!"

278
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:35,934
like we want it to be quick, quick, quick.

279
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:37,415
Clara: Yeah.

280
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,400
Casey: We'll get you there, Clara.

281
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't think we're there yet.

282
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,959
That's why gonna work
on this together today.

283
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,600
But we will.

284
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,120
I think this next resume
version is gonna be like,

285
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,610
"DUH she's qualified for this job!"

286
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,410
anyone who up resume is gonna
say, that's what we need.

287
00:11:49,469 --> 00:11:50,709
Clara: I really hope so.

288
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,209
Casey: You've got the
experience, that's clear.

289
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,699
Clara: I, I definitely do I just kinda

290
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,010
Casey: Just how do we frame it.

291
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:03,840
Clara: So, yeah, so this worksheet has
been both good and, uh, frustrating

292
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:04,960
Casey: Sure, sure.

293
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,400
So for the frustrating part, I'm glad
we get to work together on it now 'cause

294
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,560
I think doing it in a pair really - it
helps me when I'm doing my own, I

295
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,680
try to get in a second pair of eyes.

296
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,480
It can reduce the stress a lot.

297
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,250
Clara: Yeah.

298
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,930
So what happens now?

299
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,570
Do we go through this?

300
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,890
Do we, I have to delete, basically, I
have to delete everything under each of

301
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,890
my jobs, under my traditional style resume

302
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:30,545
Casey: Yeah.

303
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:30,775
Yeah.

304
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:33,410
Clara: to insert the
appropriate things, but yeah.

305
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:37,545
Casey: So I wanna talk through this so
I'm, I can follow what you have here,

306
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,305
at least the highlights of each one.

307
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:42,605
So first topic, data driven
clinical decision making.

308
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:46,645
Oh yeah, I like that.

309
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,365
You change the font needs.

310
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:48,805
They're different.

311
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:49,045
Yep.

312
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:51,125
Different clauses to
the same kind of idea.

313
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,445
Straight from the job
description probably.

314
00:12:53,445 --> 00:12:53,645
Right,

315
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:54,805
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

316
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:55,485
Casey: Right.

317
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,365
So tell me about your
highlight experiences here.

318
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:02,335
Oh, um, first I wanna mention in
my worksheet, I separate highlight

319
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,655
experiences, which is this part from
the how to grow and develop further.

320
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:09,625
And for some people, there's
a lot in the how to grow part.

321
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:11,505
If you have a dream job,
you wanna grow into it.

322
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:14,345
But most people that I work with
actually have so much in the

323
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:15,385
highlight experiences already.

324
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,145
That's where we focus.

325
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:20,025
So Clara, I today we can mostly focus
on the highlight experiences and

326
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,105
try to get each into the resume that

327
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,305
I know you have in you already.

328
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:23,545
then the how to grow.

329
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:25,985
I mean, we can talk about it,
but that's maybe not the focus

330
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:28,135
feel free to bring it up, but All right.

331
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:28,895
Highlight experiences.

332
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:29,295
Ready?

333
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:30,355
I'm ready to hear about this.

334
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,520
Clara: All right, so first three
about evaluating data, data-driven

335
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,630
decision making,  usually involving
research practices, training,

336
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,510
evaluation, implementation, et cetera.

337
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:41,175
Casey: Mm-Hmm.

338
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:44,605
Clara: So I kind of put all
those together because that is,

339
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,725
those are all pieces of the same process.

340
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:50,845
Um, from data to implementation.

341
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:52,965
It should be, that is
the data-driven process.

342
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:57,605
So I put in highlights where
I took specific initiatives

343
00:13:57,745 --> 00:13:59,005
and data-driven processes.

344
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,205
The first thing I have listed there is the

345
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:03,965
Learning management system at
ACPM, my previous employer.

346
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:05,645
And, um.

347
00:14:07,385 --> 00:14:11,315
the learning management
system is their software for

348
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,779
storing, organizing and delivering

349
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:15,859
their education material.

350
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,939
I went in there, I looked at
what was doing well, what wasn't.

351
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,939
I changed what appeared
in the featured section,

352
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:24,699
how the homepage appeared

353
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:28,249
based on feedback directly
from participants and students.

354
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,249
I also went through and I looked
at where people are clicking,

355
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,209
where they're not clicking,

356
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:37,269
how they're getting to certain
courses that are doing well.

357
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,389
Some courses, they got to
it through the main page.

358
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:43,069
Some courses, they only ever went to
it through the link they were given

359
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:45,309
because the page was too
difficult to navigate

360
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:46,509
or they couldn't find it

361
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:49,719
because our search engine
needed a little bit more work.

362
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:52,199
The, the keywords
weren't working properly.

363
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:53,639
So I went in there and changed those.

364
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,279
I tagged,  I edited the metadata.

365
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,549
I worked with the company
that was supporting us, uh,

366
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,029
month over month with IT questions

367
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,389
to explain to me more

368
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:07,749
how we could better utilize
the system they've built.

369
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:11,149
So I spent a lot of time in
that learning management system,

370
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:16,229
collecting data, realizing what
was wrong, fixing it, changing it,

371
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:20,189
implementing later on
how we upload courses,

372
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,780
what information we prioritize
putting in there,  and how

373
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,700
we can streamline a process

374
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,550
from an in-person program

375
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,410
to the evaluation that they
have to take after the program

376
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,690
in that learning management system.

377
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,530
So that was a lot of data-driven work.

378
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:35,625
Casey: Right.

379
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:38,735
part of me wants to write all
that down, but there's a separate

380
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:40,855
exercise I wanna do for stories.

381
00:15:40,895 --> 00:15:42,305
That's on worksheet four.

382
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,135
on interview stories.

383
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,905
So once we get to that point, we'll
have the questions, we'll answer the,

384
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,625
those questions with these stories.

385
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:49,545
And you have plenty of those

386
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:53,025
for this part, for the resume,
to get through the screening.

387
00:15:54,075 --> 00:15:56,375
Uh, for the LMS, this bullet point,

388
00:15:56,475 --> 00:15:57,855
how do you know you were successful?

389
00:15:58,155 --> 00:15:59,055
How would someone look at,

390
00:15:59,205 --> 00:15:59,895
--okay, you've done it

391
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,895
you've done this kind of work, sure, sure.

392
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:02,495
But did it work?

393
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,655
Did it meet your outcomes?

394
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:04,255
How do you know?

395
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,160
Clara: Oh, I know.

396
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,360
Because

397
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:12,240
sales increase for those products by 30%,
where they were over year, over year.

398
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,695
Casey: Wow, that's huge

399
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:19,545
year over year.

400
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:20,185
I know that.

401
00:16:22,085 --> 00:16:22,795
Leave me alone

402
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:28,095
Okay.

403
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:28,375
Okay.

404
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,455
That, that's a great resume line.

405
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,325
Think that's the, that's the advice
everybody knows is like how do

406
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,045
you add metrics to your resume,

407
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,050
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

408
00:16:36,105 --> 00:16:36,765
Casey: uh, via.

409
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,850
X, Y, Z and we can come back to that
when we're in the resume itself.

410
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,410
I think it'll be easier
to come up with those few.

411
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,730
Clara: Yeah.

412
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,270
Casey: Wow.

413
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,630
What a good resume line.

414
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,980
Uh, data driven.

415
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,140
We wanna have that phrase
that's pretty important to them.

416
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,300
And it's true.

417
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,230
Clara: data-driven,
evidence-based process.

418
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,570
Casey: Yeah.

419
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,070
okay.

420
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,150
Can we include the word evidence?

421
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,610
Sometimes I like to take notes
on the words to put places.

422
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,800
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

423
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,585
Casey: If they use the word evidence,
you should use the word evidence,

424
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:13,785
not a synonym as much.

425
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,425
I've had this problem before.

426
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:18,465
I said I am, uh, an Ember JS developer,

427
00:17:18,465 --> 00:17:20,545
and someone told me, "oh, well
you don't know JavaScript"

428
00:17:21,785 --> 00:17:22,265
Ember JS.

429
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:23,185
The JS is JavaScript.

430
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:24,065
It stands for that; they didn't know!

431
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:25,945
The screener was not technical
enough to know that was

432
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:27,865
equivalent, or similar, or related.

433
00:17:28,045 --> 00:17:31,695
So in tech I have to put
JavaScript apparently!

434
00:17:31,755 --> 00:17:34,495
If the screener might not know
all the specific languages.

435
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,565
But then the hiring manager, they
know and it's like redundant.

436
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:38,445
It's a wasted word.

437
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,765
It's like not adding much
value for the density.

438
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:44,325
But anyway, the audience of this one,
I'm telling all this to make a big point.

439
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,605
It's the screener, the HR screener, or

440
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:48,605
someone who might not have all
the context --they have to get it.

441
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:49,995
Clara: Yeah.

442
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:51,135
Casey: I love that you
called out evidence.

443
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:51,915
We wanna have that word there.

444
00:17:53,255 --> 00:17:53,675
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

445
00:17:54,095 --> 00:17:54,355
Casey: All right.

446
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:57,515
Um, are these in rough priority order
or the order that you thought of them?

447
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,695
Clara: The order that I thought of them,

448
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,735
and usually that to do

449
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:03,655
with the difficulty level it was,

450
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:05,615
or like how intense that experience was.

451
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:08,995
has very little to do how
relevant I think it is.

452
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,160
Casey: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I happen to remember the
LMS when we talked before,

454
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,360
so I know that is a big deal

455
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,000
and the kind of thing that, folks
hiring you might be interested in.

456
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,760
But anyway, for the
next- there's a lot here.

457
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,680
If you had to pick what's the
next most important one to THIS

458
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,720
employer for the health equity
manager at CVS, that kind of thing?

459
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:27,680
Clara: Hmm.

460
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,640
It would be the next one.

461
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:38,720
Um, those next two bullets go together,
and then it would be the one that

462
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,180
says, uh, researching best practices
for learning and listening modules.

463
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,175
Casey: Great, Okay.

464
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:49,155
X is just my placeholder.

465
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:52,405
You can't make it an empty bullet
until you do anyway, whatever.

466
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:54,400
Alright, tell me about this one.

467
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,640
Researching best practices for
learning and listing modules.

468
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,800
That sounds like something
specific I might not know.

469
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:04,035
Clara: Um, it's just a summative sentence.

470
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,075
I was trying to get it out of
my head as quick as possible,

471
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,475
but I was serving on the racial

472
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:11,130
Casey: Okay, so the term
might be relevant to this.

473
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:13,515
Clara: no, term isn't relevant.

474
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:19,395
I was, uh, serving on the racial health
equity committee when I was working at the

475
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:21,045
hospital's population health department.

476
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:27,165
When I was there, I had to help and
oftentimes lead the development and

477
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:35,120
implementation of, uh, racial health
training and education in, uh, structures,

478
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,560
modules, information, which involved, uh,

479
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,800
it involved listening sessions
where we had discussions about

480
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,640
how comfortable people are about talking
about race, et cetera, et cetera.

481
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,160
We had internal discussions about
what information to prioritize

482
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,040
that everyone learn as foundational
or, uh, baseline information.

483
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,600
How to incorporate the knowledge
and information we learn into

484
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,000
best practices related to working with
diverse groups, culturally diverse

485
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:02,505
Casey: Yeah.

486
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:02,645
Yeah.

487
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:03,265
Clara: groups of people.

488
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,520
Um, so that involves a lot of
research about best practices for

489
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,560
leading discussions about difficult
or racially driven conversations.

490
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:23,535
Um, it has, uh, a lot to do with finding,
uh, industry acceptable resources

491
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:26,335
for building out those tools
so that we could be on-par

492
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:30,735
and it could also be easily
acceptable across the different

493
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:31,975
levels of the institution.

494
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,655
You know, I was working
within a larger institution

495
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:40,805
and so the researching best practices
had a lot to do with like information

496
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:44,365
as well as how best to
integrate that information into

497
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,725
where I was working at the time.

498
00:20:46,655 --> 00:20:47,995
Casey: How do you know that was helpful?

499
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,955
Sometimes, mean, I am someone
who, I wanna do research a lot,

500
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:53,235
but sometimes I'll do research
and do the same thing in the end

501
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:54,675
and someone could criticize me.

502
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:56,785
They have before some, (saying
that) it wasn't useful.

503
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:58,135
think it might've been anyway.

504
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:00,225
But how would you prove to the skeptic?

505
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:01,345
That's what I wanna know here.

506
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,360
Clara: Well, we cr, we
led the entire hospital.

507
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,760
Our department was the first one to get
our committee up standing and going,

508
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,880
and it was so useful, so helpful.

509
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,480
Everyone liked it so much

510
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,560
that they actually gave us the "Excellence
in Diversity and Awareness Award"

511
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,560
for our work on that committee.

512
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,400
Casey: Wow,

513
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,550
this committee won the the...

514
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,060
cool

515
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,685
Yeah, look, that's proof.

516
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:31,045
Uhhuh

517
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:32,295
. 
Ah, sure.

518
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:34,005
Uh, did that,

519
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:36,015
were you, on the committee,
was it a small group?

520
00:21:36,015 --> 00:21:37,295
Were you a leader of it?

521
00:21:37,985 --> 00:21:40,685
Did you do the most of the research that
part of the, what the committee did?

522
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:41,775
how was your involvement?

523
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,080
Clara: The committee was four to...

524
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,200
I would say four to 10 people

525
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,880
because it, we get more or less people.

526
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,355
Throughout the year,
depending on what we're doing,

527
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:53,775
Casey: Yeah.

528
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:58,555
Clara: four to 10 people, I would call
myself more of a leader of in that group

529
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,715
because I did a lot of work developing

530
00:22:01,615 --> 00:22:05,835
the questions for book clubs,
facilitating conversations,

531
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:10,795
talking through the structure of how
to lead those, uh, listening sessions.

532
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:14,675
Um, and you know,

533
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,940
Talking through how to use the
resources available to us to get it.

534
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,740
To get it in.

535
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,620
So I think that I was pretty

536
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:23,215
Casey: Okay, cool.

537
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,060
Clara: involved

538
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,975
Casey: can safely say, um,
you were leading a committee.

539
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:28,215
That's roughly true.

540
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:30,455
It's more true than saying
you were just a member.

541
00:22:30,635 --> 00:22:31,095
So I would

542
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,145
summarize it to: you led the committee.

543
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:36,775
I don't think that's being deceptive
because there's often multiple

544
00:22:36,775 --> 00:22:38,895
leaders of the group anyway,
this kind of committee structure.

545
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:42,625
But we don't need to say a whole
sentence about how you were

546
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,505
only partially responsible.

547
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:45,785
That's really easy to
WANT to do in resumes.

548
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:47,465
I wanna be very accurate and
give everyone else credit,

549
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:50,375
but it's not functional
for a skimming person.

550
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,075
That's (not what) they need to know.

551
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,285
Anyway, so led the committee,

552
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:01,845
which one?

553
00:23:03,385 --> 00:23:04,485
That's the line we could use.

554
00:23:04,485 --> 00:23:05,145
Something like that.

555
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:08,655
And then what we to get back in here,

556
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,935
which we don't have yet, is

557
00:23:10,205 --> 00:23:12,575
they're looking for the data-driven
clinical decision making.

558
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:13,915
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

559
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:16,105
Casey: You just told me
all about how you did it

560
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,225
and how can we say it short?

561
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:18,745
Based on.

562
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,820
Industry best practices.

563
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,100
That just sound, feels very, know, weak.

564
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,860
I think there's gotta be
some kind of specific thing.

565
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:31,955
Clara: I, yeah, that's tough because
I'm not really sure how to, we,

566
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,930
Casey: Did you package the research?

567
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,850
Did you write a report about
it based on 100 sources?

568
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,290
I'm trying to find like numbers.

569
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:39,810
I don't know.

570
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,850
Just one idea.

571
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,770
Clara: No, I didn't package it

572
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:42,830
Casey: in

573
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,410
what were you thinking?

574
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,750
Clara: that way.

575
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,210
We had an internal document
where we collected the,

576
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,930
the direction in our goals
for teaching and learning

577
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,690
where we listed all of our resources,

578
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,950
that we were going to use.

579
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,149
But

580
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,945
Casey: that was probably used
by other departments, right?

581
00:23:58,245 --> 00:23:59,304
The resources document.

582
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:01,969
Clara: Yes, that is used
by other departments.

583
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,050
It's still used in that,
that department actually,

584
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:06,250
um, even though I no longer work there,

585
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,880
Casey: Cool.

586
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,669
Clara: and like I said, we were
the first departmental committee

587
00:24:13,689 --> 00:24:14,629
to do something like that.

588
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,790
Um, the institution had it at a
high level, but not our hospital

589
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,775
and not, other departments.

590
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:23,095
So.

591
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,850
I think a lot of people used what we did

592
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,290
as a blueprint for how to do theirs.

593
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,500
Casey: Yeah!

594
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,900
Oh man, how can we highlight that?

595
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:46,820
Uh, I might say our work was used by, how
do we say many people in a specific way?

596
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,190
Many departments?

597
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,740
Our foundational work, how's that?

598
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:52,940
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

599
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,420
Casey: is that true?

600
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,250
Clara: Yeah.

601
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:55,650
Actually,

602
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,220
Casey: To improve patient outcomes.

603
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,850
Clara: That was the goal.

604
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,770
That's always the goal at the hospital.

605
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,360
Casey: Any metrics you can tie to it?

606
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,640
No, no numbers.

607
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,680
Uh, how do you know it successful?

608
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,800
People said it was valuable.

609
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,320
That's pretty good.

610
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,440
Uh,

611
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:13,005
Clara: People said it was valuable.

612
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:16,775
The hospital overall
recognized the value of it and.

613
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,480
Casey: Yeah, the award, uh-huh.

614
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,675
Clara: What I, if I were to say, if
I were just speaking colloquially,

615
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:25,195
how I would measure
success in that is because

616
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:27,875
we were the population health department,

617
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,355
meaning we would go out into the
community and do these things.

618
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:35,635
So I heard from a lot of community
health workers and PRNs or, or rather,

619
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,355
uh, part-time nurses that

620
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:43,395
how the information that
they learned, about context

621
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:47,125
for maybe some decision
making that people have

622
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:50,765
or the way certain behaviors play out.

623
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:55,365
How that affected how
compassionate and patient

624
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:56,685
they were able to be in their work,

625
00:25:56,695 --> 00:26:00,045
which can be very difficult if you're
someone who's providing resources

626
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:01,565
to the community at that level.

627
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,400
Casey: Cool.

628
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,370
I love hearing that.

629
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,150
So not only the company through the
award, but also you heard from . Folks

630
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,910
on the ground, how helpful this was.

631
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,790
That is so heartwarming.

632
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,590
I love that kind of thing.

633
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,190
Yeah.

634
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,470
People want to -I know that -people
want to do this kind of thing

635
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:17,710
and listen and be compassionate,

636
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:20,710
sometimes they need some kind of
awareness they don't have yet.

637
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,710
Even if they're interested and
have time, they need the skills

638
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,830
-and you're filling that gap.

639
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,830
cool.

640
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,750
Uh, had overwhelming.

641
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:39,990
Is that true?

642
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,950
It might not be true.

643
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,740
Uh, positive feedback from
community health workers,

644
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,160
Is that something that
CVS would care about?

645
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,880
Community health workers?

646
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,200
Is there another way to say that
audience in a way they'd care about?

647
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,295
Clara: I don't know how to
say in a way that they would

648
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:57,495
care about, but that is true!

649
00:26:58,155 --> 00:27:01,335
I'm gonna say I think that
there's a more general term, like

650
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:06,255
public health, population health workers,
public health workers, that kind of thing.

651
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:06,915
Casey: Yeah.

652
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,470
Clara: because they specifically
mentioned one of their, their,

653
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,790
some of their goals have to do
with health equity, analytics,

654
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:24,070
bias reduction and diversity,
equity and inclusion practices.

655
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,270
And is definitely in that
wheelhouse, which is why is

656
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,030
something that came to mind.

657
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,990
'cause our whole thing
is about health equity.

658
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:34,150
So I think bias reduction and all
those things are important when

659
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,895
you're someone like a community health
worker or a public health nurse.

660
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:55,635
Casey: Um, this group
came up with training.

661
00:27:59,335 --> 00:28:03,115
Uh, we can come back to wordsmithing
this later, but something like this, I

662
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,995
feel like captures the essence you did.

663
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:07,415
That sounds good.

664
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,615
If you just said you
led a committee, alone,

665
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:10,855
I don't think I'd be that impressed,

666
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:13,585
but of course, companies have
subcommittees and people lead them.

667
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:14,615
Yeah, yeah -what did y'all do?

668
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:15,205
Did you do stuff?

669
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:16,505
Did you just meet every
week and do nothing?

670
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:17,875
That happens sometimes,

671
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,730
but THIS wow - you got an award
AND the people on the ground

672
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,410
who liked it, both

673
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,010
like leadership and...

674
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,560
that's what I'm looking
for for this kind of thing,

675
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,960
and the award is really
actually very powerful

676
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,760
even though sometimes I
think that they're silly

677
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,360
-companies giving awards
to their departments,

678
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,400
but they're really effective.

679
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,480
They're really powerful at signaling
what the company values and

680
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,800
celebrating people who did good work.

681
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,360
So I've been coming around to
enjoying awards at companies now.

682
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:44,980
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

683
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,230
Casey: Well, um, so we're not gonna
get through everything, clearly,

684
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,310
in this session, but hopefully you'll get
the pattern of like, what kinds of things

685
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,790
I'm looking for and the questions are.

686
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,190
Generally, it's like, how do we know?

687
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,270
How do we prove it to a skeptic?

688
00:28:59,250 --> 00:28:59,670
Clara: Mm-Hmm.

689
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,870
Casey: Would you rather go to another
section or do another one in here?

690
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:09,075
Clara: Uh,

691
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:10,765
Casey: Or shift gears to your resume.

692
00:29:10,825 --> 00:29:12,325
If you're ready for that, that's fine too.

693
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:14,355
Clara: yeah, I'd rather shift resume.

694
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:15,975
Casey: Let's do that.

695
00:29:16,145 --> 00:29:23,000
Clara: yeah, it's, I, I,
can drop my, Uh, my, um,

696
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,330
I've been calling it my fake resume,

697
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,210
my resume that has a bunch
of old bullet points in it.

698
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,570
'cause it just makes me too
sad to delete it all at once.

699
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:32,610
Um,

700
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:32,815
Casey: Yeah.

701
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:33,995
Cool.

702
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:35,355
Yeah, I think we're at a good point here.

703
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:38,675
I think you've, you've probably seen
like what I'm looking for in these

704
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:42,514
and what it looks like to, I
guess, um, crystallize what

705
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,594
you've brainstormed here earlier.

706
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:45,105
I'm really glad you
brainstormed this much.

707
00:29:45,105 --> 00:29:46,674
It made this go a lot smoother and faster.

708
00:29:47,464 --> 00:29:50,735
Um, so next, I think we can
start putting this kind of thing

709
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:52,485
into your resume and see how it fits,

710
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:55,094
and then we'll go back and forth
between what they're looking for

711
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:57,654
from the job description, from your
themes that you pulled out here

712
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,054
and comparing that to your resume.

713
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:00,995
We'll do that next time.

714
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:02,565
Clara: All right.

715
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:03,455
Casey: This is starting to good!

716
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,895
I mean, it's still very obvious to me
you have all of the competent skills

717
00:30:06,915 --> 00:30:08,975
and background and evidence
to get this next job,

718
00:30:11,405 --> 00:30:12,265
. 
All right, talk to you soon.

719
00:30:13,305 --> 00:30:13,595
Clara: Okay,

720
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:14,295
Casey: Bye, Clara.
